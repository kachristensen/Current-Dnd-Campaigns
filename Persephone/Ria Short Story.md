Gather close, ye wanderers bold,  
And hear a tale from days of old—  
Of gleaming scales and riddles tight,  
And whispers born in moonless night.

In Bronzeshade Hollow, deep and wide,  
Where cliffs like dragon’s teeth do bide,  
A dragonling—young, sharp, and sly—  
Made his lair where shadows lie.

His name? Virellan, bronze and bright,  
With eyes like coins in lantern-light.  
Not old, not strong, but quick of thought—  
And fond of puzzles mortals brought.

Now once a week, without a sound,  
A shepherd vanished from the ground.  
Their flocks were left, untouched, alive—  
But not a soul of them did survive.

The village cried, “A curse! A blight!  
Some ancient beast that hunts at night!”  
They blamed the dragon, sharp and keen—  
Though none had heard or truly seen.

So came a mage, all proud and wise,  
With runes like stars behind his eyes.  
He climbed the cliffs to seek the wyrm,  
Intent to slay, or make him squirm.

But Virellan smiled, and offered tea.  
“For once, dear guest, do sit with me.  
You seek a foe that stalks and steals—  
But I suspect there’s more that squeals.”

A game they played—of clue and thought,  
Each riddle solved, a truth was caught.  
The mage confessed, “The tale feels... bent.  
The marks don’t match a dragon’s scent.”

So down they went, the pair, by night,  
To stalk the thief and set things right.  
And lo—beneath a moonless grin,  
They found the culprit slinking in.

Not dragon, ghost, nor fey-born shade—  
But **Mayor Glenth**, in beastly trade!  
A lycanthrope, with cursed blood kin,  
Who fed on fear to keep his sin.

They caught him swift, they bound him fast,  
The curse unmasked, the threat long past.  
And though the townsfolk stood aghast,  
They thanked the wyrm with gifts amassed.

So if you roam near Bronzeshade’s crest,  
And hear a chuckle in your rest—  
Fear not the wyrm, who walks with grace—  
But question first the human face.
