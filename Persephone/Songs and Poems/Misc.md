Men are silent for the night
All turned in as daylight dies
But one soul lies anxious wide awake
Fearing all manner of beasts, gods and plagues
My-dear darling Sally shut your eyes
Lie still, lie silent, utter no cries

As the Rexum, brave and bold
Paints his blade with gold
He'll chop and slice you
Cut and dice you
Eat you up whole
Eat you whole




Yo, ho, all together
The end of an age is nigh,
Demons and kin, dragons and men,
One day you too will die



Rembrandt, remember  
His golden sun splendor  
A smile to die for  
A man worth an eye for


Vera, darling, take it from me
One look at him is all it takes to see
The only time Rembrandt gets an erection
Is when his gaze lies in the male direction
Trust me, you're barking up the wrong tree
