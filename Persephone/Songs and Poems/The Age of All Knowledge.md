We drink to our youth, to the days come and gone  
For the Age of All Knowledge is just about done  
They’ve stolen our music, our arts and our tomes  
With their fire and our blood, they’ve taken our homes

Down with the golden, the bronze and the red,  
The black and the green, we’ll rejoice when they’re dead  
We’re the children of darkness, and we fight all our lives  
And when oblivion beckons, every one of us dies

But this land is ours and we’ll see it wiped clean,  
Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams

We drink to our youth, to the days come and gone  
For the Age of Our Knowledge is just about done
