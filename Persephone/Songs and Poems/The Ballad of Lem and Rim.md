"The Ballad of Lem and Rim"
Songs by Persephone

VERSE 1

Tell me now, do you know
Of the brothers named 
Lem and Rim
They’ve been together through thick and thin
And they’ve still miles to go–hey! 

I’ll tell you now, the tale of them
Of handsome Rim 
And sultry Lem
They’re lovers of havoc and great mayhem
Give ‘em a grand hello–hey! 

REFRAIN

Now, now
I’ll start with Lem
He’s quite the sight to see
How, now
Lovely Lem
No greater knight than he

Wow, now
Then onto Rim
He’s captured many hearts
How, now
Fiery Rim
I’ll sing this now to start–hey!

VERSE 2

Lem’s hair is fair, Lem’s cock is hard
He’s the talk of every maid afar
His eyes are gold
His hands are bold
He’s known from land to sea

He likes the girls, but prefers them old
They’ve got more to give 
And more to hold
He likes it when they tease and scold
But don’t tell ‘im I told thee

VERSE 3 

Next is Rim, you know what, though
He’s a selfless lover, by and true
His hair’s as red
As the ground he’s tread
When he leaves, the ladies rue

With hammer in hand, and rod at stand
He strikes his mighty forge again
All across the land
No better man
Nor any quite as large

REFRAIN

Hey, now
Raise a drink to them
They’re quite the sight to see
How, now
Lem and Rim
No greater pair can be

Up, down
They can go
To bring you to your knees
Bow, down
And toss some gold
Thanks, and pretty please

Hey, now
Raise a drink to them
They’re quite the sight to see
How, now
Lem and Rim
No greater pair can be–hey! 

Up, down
They can go
To bring you to your knees
Bow, down
And toss some gold
Thanks, and pretty please–hey!
