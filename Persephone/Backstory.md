Themes: Eldritch Horror, Dark Tragedy, Motherhood

*Blood bride. Blood wife. Blood mother.*

*The race of humans are strangers to long life. Our short, miniscule lifespans pale in length to that of immortals. Yet I met one, in my youth. His name was Hades. Dark hair, tall, eyes that were mesmerizing pools of secrets. We fell in love, and my kind reacted in horror, then exile, when I chose my lover over my people. We spent our days in blood and debauchery. We conquered and killed, built and destroyed, dabbled in lives of great good and great evil.* 

*When we married, we bound our vows not with rings, but with an eye for an eye. There was no pain when I plucked mine from my head, viridian in color, nor was there when he replaced it with his own. With mine right eye now his, and his mine, we became two half-things of a whole. My form became darker, more like his, and his became mortal.*

*It is rare for his kind to conceive or sire children. Yet, half-things we had become, soon my belly swelled with child. It excited us. Terrified us. The day we found out, we abandoned our grand designs, our soldiers, our kingdoms. All had become dust, tasteless in our mouths compared to the joy that was new life. We rejoiced, secluded ourselves in the woods, and lived lives as a simple man and woman would. Husband and wife–and soon, father and mother.*

*The birth was… difficult. We had vowed that death was not the end, but it was the first time it had drawn so near to us. He refused to cut the babe from my belly until I wielded the blade myself–better to lose only one and not both.*

*A son. We had a son. Blood red hair, rosy cheeks, two emerald eyes. He was perfect. For the first time in our long, long lives, we had created something purely untainted. Something holy. Something new. Zagreus.*

*Yet others did not forget our misdeeds so quickly.*

*We had made many enemies, though this time they came in the form of those who I once called my family, the humans I had long since abandoned. Hades fought, but our lives of peace and the end of the Demonic Age had weakened us. We begged them to spare our newly born son. They killed my husband with a dagger to the eye, and scoured mine with acid. The last I remember was watching them carry our son away, before they left me to die.*

*There is blackness there, in my memory. I remember the life seeping out from me. Centuries later, I reawoke. A strange thing, something inexplicable. The present age is one of discordance, of the rise and warfare of men and the gods. It is an odd era, but one I find necessary to navigate. Did our son inherit our long life? Had they killed him? Had he manifested any of our powers? Was he gone, after siring a long line of descendants? Did anything remain of him or Hades?*

*I do not know why or how I am back, but I must find out what happened.*
