## Summary
The party continued northeast back through the forest towards rebel territory, where they rescued a survivor of a skirmish, Connor, pinned down under his horse.

## IC Synopsis - Ria

>Journey northward initiated under the observation of the Living God cultist (Zindara) spoken to on the previous night. No pursuit noted following our exit from Barca. The chosen route retraced our initial path, circumventing the farm. 
  First camp broken before reaching the river delta, as Lewis cannot see in the dark. Perimeter search performed by Rembrandt; nothing of note. Tensions between Rembrandt and other party members barring Valindra persist. Ability to work cohesively not yet significantly impacted. 
  New capabilities of note: Rembrandt: Now able to summon a mount. Current chosen form is a unicorn. 
  Valindra: New spellwork augmenting stealth of the party (Pass Without Trace spell). Use of this spell enabled the party to cross the river delta with significantly more ease, evading hostile wildlife entirely. 
  Lewis: Protective capabilities accessible via spellwork, channeled through platinum rings. (Warding Bond spell) Rings to be crafted and distributed among party members. Current holders: Lewis, Persephone 
  Incursion of fey (pixies) occurred during night watch rotation. Initial attraction to and attempted abduction of Rembrandt to be noted. Minor illusions and thrown pebbles applied in presumed attempts to separate party members (unsuccessful). Valindra was able to communicate through the Sylvan language, but learned little of use. Supposedly the pixies were interested in play— suspected ulterior motive, but no meaningfully harmful actions were taken. Attempts to put party members to sleep unsuccessful on all but Rembrandt. Abduction attempt stopped by companion drake Wuffi.
  Conclusion regarding the pixies: nuisance. Further action deemed unnecessary. 
  In conversation during watch, Valindra revealed prior service to cult leader Seraphina Blackwood (potential threat; elimination at earliest opportunity is currently in personal consideration, to be broached with the party at a later time). 
  River crossing completed without issue the following morning thanks to Valindra’s contributions (noted above). Nothing of note through the rest of the day. 
  Lewis remains fixated on the Saltway Passage. Lacking seaworthy vessels or sailing capability, the party elected to continue on land over further detours when approaching the active battle zone between the Dominion, rebellion, and extra-continental invasion forces. 
  Fey cat noted previously returned during watch the following night. Bargain brokered by Persephone remains in place, but impatience on the part of the cat was communicated. 
  Attempt made by Lewis to contact his deity for guidance during watch: “St. Imelda I've been give a gift from the Living God. I am devout to you in every way, but I am curious to explore all paths to peace. this artifact will eventually take my soul however it grants power of incredible power. Please, should i cast this item aside or embrace it?
  Response, if any, unknown at present. Compromise of Lewis via the Living God’s influence possible; will continue to monitor
  The party arrived at a battlefield the next day (location: abandoned farmland, formerly in production of wheat). Estimated 2 days old by the state of the corpses— Dominion and rebel forces only. 
  Tall Walker sans accompanying necromancer sighted, at work in the fields. Party elected to eliminate the Tall Walker. Reasoning: absence of master in control, potential for harm to the party, potential for harm to Dominion forces due to absent master. 
  Party noticed by a survivor pinned beneath a dead horse during engagement. Additional hostile ghouls drawn by the commotion. Ghouls and Tall Walker both eliminated quickly. Only minor casualties to report, no deaths.
  Of note: Lewis made a point of disparaging party members during engagement. Uncertain if the beginnings of outside influence or simple overconfidence. Will continue to observe. 
  Survivor extricated by Valindra and Rembrandt. Survivor’s uniform noted as not of any Dominion divisions; presumed rebel soldier. Potential opportunity for infiltration observed. Will have to determine rank and possible connections further up the chain of command.

## Notes
- Valindra started a conversation about the tension between Rem and I. I apologized to Ria but wasn't interested in apologizing to Rem. 
- Meta: Rem & Valindra's watch
	- fireflies following Rem. Valindra asked about his horse, Annica. She asked about blood oaths. Rem offered to teach her to ride. Rem is noticing little snowflakes/lights/autumn leaves. Valindra spoke in Sylvan, heard children's laughter, they want to play with Rem. Pixies. They're drawn to emotion & Rem's emotional distance. They used a charm/sleep/something on him.
- Meta: Valindra and Ria's watch
	- They wanted Valindra next. Rem taught them how to throw rocks so now they're throwing rocks at the others.
	- Ria asked about Solana. Was another elf who was kidnapped by the Viridian Scales, their new mistress/leader beat the shit out of her and she died. Solana was a cook, Valindra was used for manual labor. Serafina Blackwood = leader, racist towards elves. Human cult mostly. Ria skirted around suggesting vengeance.
- Perse's & Ria's watch
	- She notified me of the pixies, said to watch out for rocks. Ria noticed Rem's arms moving about, like he was being dragged. Ria sent Wuffi to go watch him, the pixies ran off.
- Next night
	- Cheshire Cat is back, same voice, "You're all incredibly boring this time."
		- He said the ones who sent the hounds after us don't like our kind. Not Yaluska. 
		- I offered the Charlatan's Die in exchange for their name, he refused. Not interested in outside forces manipulating fate.
	- Meta: Ria initiated conversation with Rem, apologized for not stopping Perse.
	- Lewis sent a msg to St. Imelda
		- Sending: StImalda I've been give a gift from the Living God. I am devout to you in everyway but I am curious to explore all paths to peace. this artifact will eventually take my soul however it grants power of incredible power Please should i cast this item aside or embrace it
		- All he got in response was a vision of the LG's hand in the sky
- Next day
	- We FINALLY got to a battlefield, lots of carrion/dead
	- Something lurking in the fields, a tall walker. The Dominion uses these creatures via necromancy to finish off the wounded, controlled by a runestone on the forehead. They're programmed to kill. Usually someone nearby that is it's master to control it. Its limbs are blades covered in fresh-ish blood. They're Undead.
		- We heard a survivor yelling out to us, crushed under a horse. We initiated combat. Ghouls swarmed Rem.
	- We killed them and then rescued Connor, rebel uniform.
