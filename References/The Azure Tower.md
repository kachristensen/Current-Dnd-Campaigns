###### Polaris
The star that shines brightest in the sky, that all travelers look to. Named after the North Star, Polaris is primarily a mercantile town that has sprung up on the outskirts of the Azure Tower. The town is filled with many merchants who seek to curry favor with the tower's mistress by presenting her with rare, exotic goods and magical reagents. Others have accumulated over time pilgrims often set up residence, start families, and often die before they ever clear the decades-long waitlist required to seek a personal audience. Finally, there are residents who have fled to Polaris seeking the Circe's protection from the encroaching Imperium. Although she has never expressed any firm opinion for or against the Empire, there are hopes she will considers the town as part of her domain and protect them should the empire come for them.
