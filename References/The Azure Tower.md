#####  Polaris
The star that shines brightest in the sky. Named after the North Star, Polaris is primarily a mercantile town that has sprung up on the outskirts of the Azure Tower. The town is filled with many merchants who seek to curry favor with the tower's mistress by presenting her with rare, exotic goods and magical reagents. Others have accumulated over time pilgrims often set up residence, start families, and often die before they ever clear the decades-long waitlist required to seek a personal audience. Finally, there are residents who have fled to Polaris seeking the Circe's protection from the encroaching Imperium. Although she has never expressed any firm opinion for or against the Empire, some hope that Circe will consider the town as part of her domain and protect them should the empire come for them.

##### Exterior
Countless unseen servants maintain both the interior and exterior of the Azure Tower. The tower is surrounded by lush, manicured gardens and vineyards for no other reason than to serve as a set piece for Circe's viewing pleasure. The townspeople of Polaris often receive baskets of fresh fruit and produce throughout the year, as there are few living things in the tower that actually require sustenance.

Scattered all throughout are marble statues of the dismembered and maimed, captured at the precise moment of death. Circe has fondly referred to them as "heads on pikes"--a macabre warning to all who would seek to siege the tower or otherwise offend her.
