## Summary
Continuing through the forest, the party navigated a river crossing full of crocodiles, spoke to the cheshire cat again, and enjoyed a respite at a brackish beach.

## IC Synopsis - Valindra

> Lord Sajj’aka your guidance has again brought us to an interesting task. These people Wuffi and I have been partnered up with are a different bunch. I have never met people so willing to… accept me? It is a different experience to say the least. I am cautious that their intents are pure, but at the moment there is nothing to tell me otherwise. I am hearted as well that Lady Drakesbane is as accepting as the others. Thank you for bringing them to me. Your will be done.
> We came across an interesting creature in the night. A Chesire Cat as it was. In their watch Persephone and Rembrandt had spoken to it and it had suggested seeking out the witch Yaluska. A name I have heard many a times in these woods. Like much of the creatures in these woods, she is not as upfront as she appears. I did warn the group of her twisting of words. Though I do no expect anyone to listen, they seemed to have heard me.
> She does live on the opposite side of our woods, and on my suggestion the party continued on with our task. A real surprise again that theses people would listen to one such as me. A day’s travel later, we reached the point where the Uaine and Varu rivers meet. The river was quite full of ravenous crocodiles. I had suggested myself as bait to lure them all away, with my speed and disposability being the right choice for such matter. The others were not so keen on this plan and drew their blades to attack and carve a path across. 
> With some minor trouble we dispatch a number of these reptiles and move through the cliffs. Finding a small cave that I noticed footprints and wagon tracks. Lady Drakesbane suggests a smuggler’s den. She is quite intelligent and I follow with the suggestion of supplies for us to collect. Persephone urges us to press on, as that we have all that we need.
> At the next river crossing was the trouble we ran into. Persephone leading the way stumbles into a larger beast than we had encountered earlier. She missed being captured, while Rem and I dove into the river to attack the beast heads on. Others then came up from the river and surround us. Both Rem and I were caught into the creature’s jaws multiple times as our allies strove to free us. After being bite several times and experiencing the pain of those teeth, we were able to come out of the battle and press on.
> As we fought, a creature, drawn to our magic bids us to the cave for safety. Its voice sounded friendly and I had suggested we follow it. The rest of the party was adamant to avoid it. As well as on our exit there was a plant asking us to feed it. Again, I was the only one of the group with curiosity of it. Perhaps they are just too weary of the Fae and my ancestry gives me a bit less fear of the unknown? 
> After a bit more travel, the cat appears to us again as we approach the edge of the forest. A bit miffed at Persephone for being denied the cup. I am not quite sure of what it speaks of, but then offer it my deck of playing cards. It looked rather upset and I would hate for it to stay that way if I could do something. Persephone relents and gives the cup up for the exchange of information. The cat then informs us about the witch again, but also notes another in the woods. Caserrah, one of the false gods. He is willing to arrange an audience. Though we agree it might be best for after our task in Barca is completed. A short while later, at dusk, we find ourselves at a beach for our camp for the night.
> As we settle in Lord Sajj’aka I have a moment to reflect. Death has circled me a few times in the last few days. I will resolve myself more. I will complete the task you have given me.

## Notes
- Yaluska is sometimes referenced as a minor forest deity, folk lore, baba yaga type thing. Powerful but known to give monkey’s paws sorts of deals. Very west of us, swampy area. 
  - The party didn’t want to detour that far so I mentioned I’d bring it up again after Barca.  
  - When we cast spells, 25% chance to hear in our mind, woman’s voice “Who is there?” It wanted to lure us in, invited us for tea, some kind of fey. Valindra wanted to go inside the cave. I told her no. We came across a giant flower thing that wanted to get fed, Valindra also wanted to feed it, we   
  - I gave the Cheshire cat a mug, he mentioned there was another false god lurking here, said if we return he gave us his word he’ll help us arrange a meeting with Caserrah, goddess of beasts, nature, forests.  
- Misc \- next to Barca is the Pillar of the Gods, path towards the grand divine  
- Beach RP  
  - Valindra prefers women, Ria seemed very uncomfortable with her body and Valindra’s attention.  
  - META: Rem has dead fam, twins, etc. Valindra has a task from Sajj’aka.
