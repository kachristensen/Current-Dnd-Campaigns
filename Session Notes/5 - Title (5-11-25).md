## IC Synopsis

>A brief rest was taken to recover following the defeat of the cult idol. 
  Items recovered: Alchemist’s Fire, 2 flasks. Charlatan’s Die. Rusty Dragontooth Glaive (weak magic enchantment, possible advancement after further study/use). +1 Greatsword. 230 gp, divided evenly among party members.
  Beastman retrieved from cellblock at Persephone’s request. Charmed and bound with rope to prevent escape and injury to the party. Brief additional examinations were performed following our exit from the caverns. Attempted communication unsuccessful (languages employed: Common, Draconic). Subject unresponsive under the effects of magical charm, and immediately aggressive when charm effects ended. Subject uninterested in food offered (rations, primarily dried meat). Alternative potential for communication via spellwork (specific spell unknown) proposed by Valindra. Subject subdued by Rembrandt and transported onward to the farm. 
  All civilians found to have returned safely to their home. Civilian (Ben) missing leg has received medical treatment. Recovery expected. Attempts made by Persephone to persuade head farmer Hansel to transport the beastman to the Dominion.
  Beastman subject secured for the night in a shed away from the farmhouse; hands and teeth removed by Persephone, assisted by Lewis to prevent premature death. Party members aside from Persephone displayed discomfort but no attempts were made to stop the procedure. Companion drake Wuffi was posted to guard the shed overnight. 
  Hansel’s wife, Gwen, attempted to refuse entry and food to Vailindra (most likely cause: superstition, fear). Issue resolved diplomatically by Rembrandt. Party reconvened in the farmhouse den following the conclusion of the beastman's “declawing”. 
  Proposal to transport the beastman denied by Hansel. Proposal to keep the beastman in custody (such as it was) until the party’s return from Barca accepted (estimated time: two weeks). 
  Following discussion between myself, Valindra, and Rembrandt on the matter of the beastman’s treatment, Rembrandt returned to the shed to execute the beastman. Brief physical altercation between Rembrandt and companion drake Wuffi- both uninjured. Remains of the beastman disposed of by Rembrandt, assisted by Lewis. Potential for ongoing conflict between party members observed, however the situation has yet to escalate.
  A portion of the remaining ale purchased before the start of our mission was consumed. The state of current party morale remains unclear. No escalation of conflict between primary involved members (Rembrandt, Lewis, Persephone, Wuffi) expected as of this writing. 
  Hansel to be informed his services are no longer required tomorrow morning, via his daughter Sarah. Payment received for rescue: 15 gp. 
  Camp established in farm exterior. All party members on watch shifts, barring Rembrandt (reason: inebriation). 
  Conversation overheard between Persephone and Valindra while resting. Subjects included speculation over what might have been done with the beastman, reasons for living, and Valindra’s intended goal to revive the dragon “Lord Sajj’aka”. Repeated interest in myself when speaking on this matter noted. Suspicion: Valindra may attempt to end my life as part of her effort to revive her “Lord”. Possible solution: dissuade Valindra from continuing to follow this idol. An attempt was made by Persephone on this front, including  in song (recorded below). True intentions on the part of Persephone remain unclear. Observation will continue for both Persephone and Valindra. 
  Camp broken at first light, journey toward Barca resumed.
  

## Notes
- Loot: Alchemist's Fire x2, Charlatan's Die, Rusty Dragon tooth Glaive, \+1 greatsword, 230 gp (/5 \= 46 ea).  
- The beast man snapped at me, so I charmed, tied up the beast man, blindfolded and deafened him, and tied him on a leash.  
  - Tied it up to a tree, seems like it was in a daze, there are humans with the Living God, also fanatical but can be communicated with, speak a dialect of Draconic. A live specimen has never been captured, they’re very violent. Tried to escape. Rem shouted stop in Draconic, tried to intimidate him with his sword, seems beastlike, not intelligent. Not interested in food. I cast calm emotions, behaving like a dog. Rem punched him unconscious and we took him to the townsfolk.  
    - We tied him in the shed, I pulled all his teeth out and severed its hands. Proposed to the townsfolk that they take him to the capital for a reward. Ria mentioned it would be dangerous – I agreed, mentioned we could ask them to keep it alive and we would pick him up again.  
    - The wife didn’t want to let Valindra inside. Rem said if she didn’t enter, he wouldn’t either–the husband let them in. Rem told them she was the only reason their kids were there, told the wife to apologize and invite her inside. They let Valindra eat in the den.  
      - Rem stayed with her, was very supportive and sweet. Said it shouldn’t be like this. He joined her in the den. Rem got super drunk.  
      - I talked Valindra up, called her a goddess, the wife was concerned it was blasphemous.  
      - Ria, Lewis, and Perse ate dinner with the townspeople, Ria went and checked on the others in the Den after she finished it.  
      - Hansel (the husband) agreed to keep the beastman for about 2 weeks or so until we returned to pick him up.  
- Rem, Valindra, Ria talked. Rem asked about if they had any issues with what I did. Ria disliked it but wasn’t surprised, said her division would likely do the same but would want to dissect it. Valindra said death was its only future.  
  - Rem said he needed to go take a piss, very drunk, walked outside, kicked the door open. Spoke to it, said they had a lot in common, they’ve both been made into more than they once were, and sometimes he feels like a dog on the leash. Mercy killing.  
    - Wuffi spoke to him, asked him what he was doing, Rem threatened to swing his sword at him. He threw Wuffi out of the shed.  
  - Lewis went out to check on him, Rem went to bury the body. Lewis went to help.  
  - Rem was short with Perse, just handed her the shovel when she joked about digging it up.  
    - Valindra and Wuffi approached him. He apologized to Wuffi.  
    - He returned to the townsfolk, invited Ben and Sara over. Ria told them to tell their father   
  - I asked Lewis about his morality, he was disturbed but has seen much brutality. Grey area.  
- We set up camp for the night.   
  - I talked to Valindra, asked her opinion. I said the beast would’ve lived, we could’ve found a cure for it. Said sometimes she would’ve wanted to die as a pet. Said Lord Sajj’aka. Said it’s a goal. I asked if she would kill herself afterwards, she wasn’t sure. Said she was surprised to be alive, I said it was well spoken. I asked about her reaction after the boss, asked about the Veridian Scales, they were her abductors and tormenters, they’re wrong. She’s not loyal to them, just Sajj’aka. They’re wrong. She’s not sure why they took her. Labor? Forest was being torn down. Her parents were slain, she was taken when she was 10\. 60 now. Everything deforested, killed. Doesn’t think her people are still there. I asked her what Sajj’aka wanted. Took her hand, motherly concern, sadness.   
    - He wants to return. Wants her to help him. The Veridian has the wrong goal. She thinks he will bring back stability. I asked why he was called The Bronze Terror. She doesn’t know. I sang her the Age of All Knowledge. She was speechless and asked if it was true, I said yes. Warned her of trusting them. She was very thoughtful and said she would love to know more later. I told her to just ask. She asked how I know, I passed it off as stories and songs. I told her she was a kindred spirit. We remained holding hands and quiet. 
- META: Rem had a dream. Golden hour field. Voice. Rembrandt, your mercy has been noticed, but is misplaced. Has been noticed. What sort of change to you wish to bring?  
  - Rem is driven by a sense of duty, has seen suffering, has the ability to help. Voice wants to meet with him soon. Called him His Son. Knows all about Rem. Said Rem will meet him soon.
