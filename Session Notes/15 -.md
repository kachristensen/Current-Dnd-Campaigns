## Summary


## IC Synopsis - 

>

- Forest clearing
	- We came across a young green dragon feasting on an elk
	- Army of dragon ppl? In green armor. They attacked us -- Valindra's Viridian Scale order.
		- The last dragon blessed refused to surrender so we killed her.
	- We were being watched by a woman and two of her men hanging in the trees, she had legendary resistance. 
		- She approached with her men to inspect the dragon. Ria recognized her as noble blood. **Vera Fontaine**, part of the Drakesbane lineage but an offshoot. Wearing dragon skin armor. She applauded Valindra for the killing blow on the dragon and offered her a dagger, threw it down. Said she wasn't with the dragon ppl. Said she was tracking the dragon, assumed the dragon ppl also wanted to kill it.
			- She called out Ria as Ms. Drakesbane, said she didn't have to hide. Vera knew her as a child. The two conversed, seemed like ok enough acquaintances. 
			- Ria introduced Vera to us. 
				- I refused to tell her my name, I told her she was asking a lot of probing questions. She said knowledge was power. Lewis introduced himself but that was it.
		- Vera asked to purchase the heart of the dragon, though said if we were going to eat it, she'd want to watch. It's the source of a dragon's power, according to legend. Ria said she doubted the young one would have anything worth, but it is tradition.
			- She offered 300g for the heart, I asked for 1.5k, she ignored me, Ria got it for 500g.
		- Vera said she's hunting for a black scaled adult dragon. Invited us to join.
			- Valindra gave her name. Vera and her were staring intensely at each other, Vera told her to take a bite of the heart, I warned Valindra against her but she didn't listen and took a bite.
				- META: Ely asked Chris how it compared to the dragon blood she's drank before. The heart is much milder and less impactful. 
			- Vera suggested that Valindra wrap some scales of the dragon around her weapon to enhance it.
				- Rem and I assisted Lewis in carving out the dragon.
				- Vera put a hand on Valindra's shoulder as she walked away, Valindra blushed.
- After Vera and the others left
	- Valindra was zoned out. I asked her if they were Veridian Scales, she said yes. She doesn't recognize them personally, doesn't know why they're here. I asked what Valindra wanted to do, she said carry on the mission, doesn't want to go out of our way to hunt them all down.
	- Valindra wants to go help hunt down the adult black dragon.
	- I asked why she wanted to protect Ria, Valindra said because the Viridian Scales were hunting the Drakesbanes, who killed Lord Sajjaka. Ria was surprised she knew. They need Ria to bring Lord Sajjaka back. The Drakesbane are Lord Sajjaka's legacy, why Ria can use their magic.
		- The Viridian Scales are wrong, Valindra says--they don't need to kill her. Lord Sajjaka told her to protect her. 
		- Ria said she has no intention of helping Lord Sajjaka. Valindra says she understands, will deal with it when the time comes, she just needs to keep her safe.
		- We asked how Ria's family inherited Sajjaka's abilities. 200 years ago, the Drakesbanes gathered to hunt and slay an ancient bronze dragon for power. Ate his heart and other things. It passed down to their descendants but has weakened across generations. The one before didn't have anything, so ppl were surprised when Ria's manifested strongly.
			- Valindra said his return was near. 
		- Valindra brought out a glass vial, was Lord SJ's blood but she consumed it out of instinct, that's when she heard him and Wuffi appeared. 
	- I asked why dragon hunters consume their prey, probably for power. 
- I cast minor illusion on Rem to conceal his form, we told him to question the dead body, Speak with Dead.
	- Rem said he was sent by Lady Blackwood.
		- Where there others? No, the lady was the last to fall. 
		- What was their mission here? Acquiring the resources.
		- Is there a camp with more of the Scales nearby? Where is the nearest place to find reinforcements? The rest should be up north. 
		- Can you give me a more precise location?
			- 4 miles northeast of here, next to a large boulder in the middle of the forest
		- How many are in the camp north of here? Seven
	- I suggested we go hunt down the camp. Valindra mentioned allying with Vera, since the Viridian Scales are also after the dragon. 
		- Rem and I weren't interested in hunting the adult dragon but agreed in hunting down the Viridian Scales. Valindra was worried about bringing Ria to them. We'll ambush them. 
			- Lewis suggested we infiltrate, bait using a prisoner.
		- Valindra says the VS always kept tabs on the DBs.
- Lewis can make scale mail armor, will have some kind of immunity or resistance. Can also enhance Valindra's weapon.
	- Valindra's glaive now does an extra 1d4 of poison damage per hit.
