## IC Synopsis -

- Forest clearing
	- We came across a young green dragon feasting on an elk
	- Army of dragon ppl? In green armor. They attacked us -- Valindra's Viridian Scale order.
		- The last dragon blessed refused to surrender so we killed her.
	- We were being watched by a woman and two of her men hanging in the trees, she had legendary resistance. 
		- She approached with her men to inspect the dragon. Ria recognized her as noble blood. **Vera Fontaine**, part of the Drakesbane lineage but an offshoot. Wearing dragon skin armor. She applauded Valindra for the killing blow on the dragon and offered her a dagger, threw it down. Said she wasn't with the dragon ppl. Said she was tracking the dragon, assumed the dragon ppl also wanted to kill it.
			- She called out Ria as Ms. Drakesbane, said she didn't have to hide. Vera knew her as a child. The two conversed, seemed like ok enough acquaintances. 
			- Ria introduced Vera to us. 
				- I refused to tell her my name, I told her she was asking a lot of probing questions. She said knowledge was power. Lewis introduced himself but that was it.
		- Vera asked to purchase the heart of the dragon, though said if we were going to eat it, she'd want to watch. It's the source of a dragon's power, according to legend. Ria said she doubted the young one would have anything worth, but it is tradition.
			- She offered 300g for the heart, I asked for 1.5k, she ignored me, Ria got it for 500g.
