- Jonas turned into a massive demon lycanthrope thing, it regens. Blood frenzy. 
	- Porto cast something on Valindra mid combat, Detect Thoughts.
	- Requires silver to kill. I gave Lewis 5 silver coins and told him to heat metal, he liquified it into Jonas's mouth.
	- Rem was bit on his shoulder and infected with lycanthropy. Lewis can't help yet. 
	- I took the silver out of Jonas's throat and handed it to Rem to kill the remaining lycanthropes. 
- We headed back to the lab.  
	- Remove curse - requires being done under a full moon, DC 17 constitution. 18 days until the next full moon.
	- I took his grimoires about demon kind, mostly legends about them being violent lords, and the dragons destroying them. Rumors that the demons went underground after. To summon them, you must perform a ritual, blood sacrifice, will let you contact a higher level demon. I took all grimoires mentioning anything about it.

		- Is there a cure to your strain?
			- Inconclusive.
		- Who were you working with in relation to Porto?
			- A demon named Mastenovti.
				- What I know - during the Demonic Age, he was one of the more powerful demon lords. Probably escaped and went underground. 
		- Is there more of your serum or research hidden elsewhere?
			- Sample F is a direct sample to infect himself, it's the only one.
		- What does Mastenovti get out of their deal?
			- He didn't say, but he asked that Jonas return to him after successfully finding a cure. 
		- Does anyone else know what you've done here or of your cure?
			- Those who know of his cure have been infected with it, or have passed.
	- Porto
		- Mastenovti desires to create soldiers to retake what is theirs. He + 3 Demon lords are left, I got their names.
		- I asked if Porto was alive during the demonic age. He said no. He was created during the Age of Ash. I asked if he was a quasit, he said yes, somewhat unique. 
		- Connection to the abyss is still tenuous, the ancient demons grow old. 
		- I asked if Porto wanted to serve me, he said no, when the demons take over he will be rewarded from Mastenovti.

		- Porto wants to know what Valindra desires and wants. 
		- Valindra asked if Mastenovti had come into any recent artifacts, I downplayed it.

		- He asked for something to find us all with. I handed him one of Mel's scales. 
		- Lewis tried to guiding bolt him, it hit but he survived. I tried to silvery barbs. We had an extremely heated conversation. I tried to persuade Lewis that demons weren't all evil, Lewis didn't care. Said he would shoot the next one I talked to immediately.
	- I dissected Jonas. He was rotting on the inside. No secomortis plague.
- Valindra asked Rem why he shoved Jonas. Bc Jonas was a liability, was going to burst into a rage. 
	- I asked if Rem wanted me to inform Aaron of what we found. He said sure.
	- Rem doesn't want to leave. I told him we should leave for somewhere less populated. I told him he will be ok, I can help manage his emotions, he'll have to let me in, I won't do anything without his consent.
	- We stayed the night. Rem stayed in the cell. Valindra and I kept watch, I stayed in the cell too.
	- We incinerated the bodies.
