## Notes
- Valindra started a conversation about the tension between Rem and I. I apologized to Ria but wasn't interested in apologizing to Rem. 
- Meta: Rem & Valindra's watch
	- fireflies following Rem. Valindra asked about his horse, Annica. She asked about blood oaths. Rem offered to teach her to ride. Rem is noticing little snowflakes/lights/autumn leaves. Valindra spoke in Sylvan, heard children's laughter, they want to play with Rem. Pixies. They're drawn to emotion & Rem's emotional distance. They used a charm/sleep/something on him.
- Meta: Valindra and Ria's watch
	- They wanted Valindra next. Rem taught them how to throw rocks so now they're throwing rocks at the others.
	- Ria asked about Solana. Was another elf who was kidnapped by the Viridian Scales, their new mistress/leader beat the shit out of her and she died. Solana was a cook, Valindra was used for manual labor. Serafina Blackwood = leader, racist towards elves. Human cult mostly. Ria skirted around suggesting vengeance.
- Perse's & Ria's watch
	- She notified me of the pixies, said to watch out for rocks. Ria noticed Rem's arms moving about, like he was being dragged. Ria sent Wuffi to go watch him, the pixies ran off.
- Next night
	- Cheshire Cat is back, same voice, "You're all incredibly boring this time."
		- He said the ones who sent the hounds after us don't like our kind. Not Yaluska. 
		- I offered the Charlatan's Die in exchange for their name, he refused. Not interested in outside forces manipulating fate.
	- Meta: Ria initiated conversation with Rem, apologized for not stopping Perse.
	- Lewis sent a msg to St. Ismelda
- Next day
	- We FINALLY got to a battlefield, lots of carrion/dead
	-
