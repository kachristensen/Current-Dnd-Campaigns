## Notes
- Valindra started a conversation about the tension between Rem and I. I apologized to Ria but wasn't interested in apologizing to Rem. 
- Meta: Rem & Valindra's watch
	- fireflies following Rem. Valindra asked about his horse, Annica. She asked about blood oaths. Rem offered to teach her to ride. Rem is noticing little snowflakes/lights/autumn leaves.
