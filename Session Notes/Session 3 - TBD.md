###### Day 1 (2/26/25)

#### Summary


#### Notes
- Short rest
	- Vesh'ta spoke to Sarannis, asked if he wanted to take her up on her offer for her to lead them to the exit. Said she would only be able to bring 4-5. Sarannis said his house doesn't leave debts unpaid, and we did help him escape. She said she was trying to extend him a favor as a kinsman.
	- I insighted - she seems sincere. I persuaded her to join us to get a chance at the dueregar. She said she would lead us to the tunnel to the surface, then leave. 
	- Vesh'ta has a pocketwatch.
	- Glubbery looked for water with the kids, didn't find any, but found a mechanical gold spiky worm thing that they use to transport ore.
		- Sebastian stole a loaf of bread, embarrassed to tell Glubbery, puffed up and said he was going to get more infamous
	- I asked Veshta if she'd been to the surface, she said yes, has an imperium pocketwatch. Deep don't usually tell time.
		- Exit is 2-3 days away. We'll need rations and water for the larger group. 
		- She asked if we were planning to eat Taevus, she asked why we kept him, soft-hearted group.
	- META: Cass spoke to Laedra in Undercommon a distance away. He lied to her and said they found a note on the Warden, she was to keep it safe, they don't have it. She passed it off to a guard and took it to the surface. She says she'll have to go back for it. He asked what the sextant does and why it's so important. She says it can reveal powerful illusions.
		- I tried to overhear with the owl, but got caught.
	- Mr. Portshire promised to paint Laedra naked in exchange for water. She agreed. TODO: ask why it's valuable.
	- Cass gave a heroic speech to everyone to perservere, he has a moonlight shining sword.
	- Valindra took the ponytail out of her hair to cover her ears.
	- We left Taevus and took the chest with the sextant with us instead. Sarannis asked Glubbery why he wanted to take him with us and persuaded him that he would be better off leaving him here, higher chance of living.
	- I asked Vesh'ta why she wanted a naked painting, she said to admire herself and show off. I asked if it was common, she said yes, Cass added that it was usually clothed.
	- Sarannis identified the spell scroll of Raise Dead. I kept it.
	- I'm wearing Captain Blackthistle's decapitated head on my waist.
- Tunnels
	- To our left, water, three prisoners (2 gnomes, 1 satyr) standing on a rickety bridge with a guard, looking like they are about to get executed.
		- We sent Valindra (scalewarden uniform) and Cass forward (guard uniform), forward. Captain Billings held up a bow to execute the prisoners. Callum, Efraim, Asim.
		- Cass said he's just arrived with his commander (Valindra), he's Captain Hanke. Told them that there was an alarm and a fire. Got the guards to leave but they ran into us so we jumped them.
		- Wuffi snapped the neck of one of the guards. Sarranis burnt one of them in the face and killed him. Portshire knocked out one. Cass bonked Captain Billings out.
		- 6 party + 3 new prisoners + 4 kids/Sebastian + 4 other npcs = 17 people. x.3 gal x 3 = 15.3 gallons (each skin = half a gallon) 30 water skins.. Will die after 3 days of water. Starvation - a week or longer.
		- The satyr had her tongue cut out. She's trusting. Freya. Gnomes.
		- Glubbery seemed to be painting something in the water, handed Sarannis a drawing of him knocking out the guard. Said he's never killed a guy before. Glubbery asked how Srns lives with himself, he said it's a way of survival/ingrained in them in the Deep. It doesn't bother Srns at all.
		- We filled up a bunch of waterskins and a 40 gallon barrel.
		- Cass values life, taking the new prisoners with us. He asked what Glubbery intends to do when they make it to the surface. Does he have a home to return to? Glubbery said sort of but doesn't want to go back yet. Has some growing to do.
		- Zephy was crying. Glubbery tried to lick her face, she wiped off her own tears and let him lick it. Said 
		- Construct was beeping faster as we came close by. Proximity monitor, alarm. Probably protecting something.
		- Valindra Thaumaturgied its hatch open, I telekinetically ripped all the wiring out. We took a bunch of rations from the guard supplies, 30-40.
		- I insighted Vesh'ta's directions as she led us out, she looks vaguely amused and a little annoyed by the distraction, but still seems confident that you should be moving forward.
- We headed a little bit deeper, musty, humid. Mr. Portshire asked when he'd get to paint Vesh'ta, I asked to join to paint them.
	- We headed under the northern mountain, marched for 2 hours, we can long rest. But there will be spider territory.
	- Glubbery asked about Cass's sword, he said it was named Cynthia. 
	- We made camp, Sarannis lit a fire. Stream nearby that some members bathed in. Sarannis enjoys the cold river, got nakey. Cass got a shave and haircut, then joined him in the river.
		- META: They have a conversation in the river. Cass told him about what he told the Dueregar. Srns asked if he frightened him, about drow reputation, why ppl look at him with disgust. Cass said yeah there are stories of his ppl. Cass said his dwarf mentor was working to rebuild relations  with the dueregar.  They joked and talked about Glubbery, not sure what he is. They talked about if they could trust Valindra, Cass was disturbed by her eyes. Srns said he thought he burnt the bridge with him and Vesh'ta, Cass said she prob won't cross them unless it benefits her. Srns thinks he can get on her good side. He's the only friend Cass has. Srns wants to lose BPJ as soon as possible cuz he may be catching feelings. Asked about each other's opinions of the women in the party. Talked about Cheria and her worship of the god Nalara. Srns not used to treating people as equals. Cass told him try not to kill as much for Zephy's sake. Srns said he would try so that he didn't unsettle her. Srns expressed curiosity in how Zephy got access to magic. Srns asked about libraries with tomes/magic. Srns said he's never had any friends before, prob just ppl ordered to be nice to him or recognized his name. Talked about elven immortality. He's not sure if his dragon/host is still granting him immortality. Srns wants the power to kill a dragon. Cass has similar goals. Cass says as long as the empire exists his name won't be cleared. 
	- Cass and Srns returned half naked/wrapped in towels to the fire, BPJ was interested. 
	- Vali did some scouting, massive spider webs on the other side. We camped on the safe sides. The fey prisoners we rescued seem super chill around Wuffi, the satyr happy to pet him.
		- Wuffi sat in front of me. He wanted to sleep next to me, I said he may stay within 5-10 ft of me. Told him he could tell Vali she didn't deserve my emotional response from before. 
	- Mr. Portshire told the kids to stay put, he was doing something special with Vesh'ta and Zubby. 
	- Vali and Srns took the first watch together.
	- Glubbery said he can use painting to do social engineering, ingratiating himself with people. His first time drawing a naked person. He tried to teach me but doesn't know the terms. Vesh'ta disrobed. Nice figure. Lean. Long hair. I asked if she was considered beautiful by Deep and surfacer dwellers. Said her eyes aren't as red as they could be by her people's standards, orange yellow. Face scarred. I asked about Srns, said male are inherently flawed, but he is attractive. She has long white hair.
	- I talked with her more, she asked me how I'd been in the Deep, if I was forced, I said yes. Struggled to survive. She asked why I was so standoffish--I explained
