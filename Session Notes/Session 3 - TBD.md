###### Day 1 (2/26/25)

#### Summary


#### Notes
- Short rest
	- Vesh'ta spoke to Sarannis, asked if he wanted to take her up on her offer for her to lead them to the exit. Said she would only be able to bring 4-5. Sarannis said his house doesn't leave debts unpaid, and we did help him escape. She said she was trying to extend him a favor as a kinsman.
	- I insighted - she seems sincere. I persuaded her to join us to get a chance at the dueregar. She said she would lead us to the tunnel to the surface, then leave. 
	- Vesh'ta has a pocketwatch.
	- Glubbery looked for water with the kids, didn't find any, but found a mechanical gold spiky worm thing that they use to transport ore.
		- Sebastian stole a loaf of bread, embarrassed to tell Glubbery, puffed up and said he was going to get more infamous
	- I asked Veshta if she'd been to the surface, she said yes, has an imperium pocketwatch. Deep don't usually tell time.
		- Exit is 2-3 days away. We'll need rations and water for the larger group. 
		- She asked if we were planning to eat Taevus, she asked why we kept him, soft-hearted group.
	- META: Cass spoke to Laedra in Undercommon a distance away. He lied to her and said they found a note on the Warden, she was to keep it safe, they don't have it. She passed it off to a guard and took it to the surface. She says she'll have to go back for it. He asked what the sextant does and why it's so important. She says it can reveal powerful illusions.
		- I tried to overhear with the owl, but got caught.
	- Mr. Portshire promised to paint Laedra naked in exchange for water. She agreed. TODO: ask why it's valuable.
	- Cass gave a heroic speech to everyone to perservere, he has a moonlight shining sword.
	- Valindra took the ponytail out of her hair to cover her ears.
	- We left Taevus and took the chest with the sextant with us instead. Sarannis asked Glubbery why he wanted to take him with us and persuaded him that he would be better off leaving him here, higher chance of living.
	- I asked Vesh'ta why she wanted a naked painting, she said to admire herself and show off. I asked if it was common, she said yes, Cass added that it was usually clothed.
	- Sarannis identified the spell scroll of Raise Dead. I kept it.
- Tunnels
	- To our left, water, three prisoners (2 gnomes, 1 satyr) standing on a rickety bridge with a guard, looking like they are about to get executed.
		- We sent Valindra (scalewarden uniform) and Cass forward (guard uniform), forward. Captain Billings held up a bow. 
		- Cass said he's just arrived with his commander (Valindra), he's Captain Hanke. Told them that there was an alarm and a fire. Got the guards to leave but they ran into us so we jumped them.
