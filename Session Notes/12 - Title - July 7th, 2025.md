## Notes
- Lewis's convo with Aaron
	- Aaron suggested we take out the rebels, Lewis thinks we shouldn't. He told Aaron one of them is a noble. Aaron suggested they discuss it with Rem.
- META: Rem's convo with Jonas
	- Jonas says he's not allied with either the rebels or the Dominion, but isn't sure about sharing it yet. Jonas wants Rem to help him escape, Rem asked for a reason to trust him/believe his cure and that he will use it to help people. Jonas asked for binds loosening, Rem moved a crate over for them to sit on. 
		- Jonas's other affliction competes with the secomortis plague, so both are "stabilized."
	- Ria and Rem conferred, she thinks he's hiding something and is concerned. Also not sure if we'll get the rebel's writ with just one prisoner. They won't let us leave with Jonas. Rem talked about Valindra/Perse making a distraction to smuggle him out. Ria suggested that they tell him some info about trying to ingratiate themselves with the rebels in order to get what they need. 
- Lewis's sending to Perse
	- I fear the captain is interested in the Rexums artifacts. Keep Valindra and move away from the camp. thought our station was more recognized.
		- Perse response:  "He's interested because you TOLD him EVERYTHING. And now you bid me obey your ~unparalleled~ wisdom? Horse-muck, street dung, absolute imbecile. Shove your cock--"
- META: Rem, Ria, Lewis returned to confer with Aaron
	- Rem asked about what Jonas had told Aaron, not much. They conferred about Jonas's "unholy" infection. Rem thinks maybe he's consorting with an outside force not in their pantheon. Rem encouraged him to let Jonas go so that Jonas can continue to progress his work, Ria encouraged it so that Jonas would let his guard down. 
		- Aaron was troubled by the nature of the cure, considering execution.
	- Aaron spoke of what Lewis told him about our mission, Lewis was silent.
