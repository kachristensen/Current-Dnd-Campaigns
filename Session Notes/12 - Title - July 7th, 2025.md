## Notes
- Lewis's convo with Aaron
	- Aaron suggested we take out the rebels, Lewis thinks we shouldn't. He told Aaron one of them is a noble. Aaron suggested they discuss it with Rem.
- META: Rem's convo with Jonas
	- Jonas says he's not allied with either the rebels or the Dominion, but isn't sure about sharing it yet. Jonas wants Rem to help him escape, Rem asked for a reason to trust him/believe his cure and that he will use it to help people. Jonas asked for binds loosening, Rem moved a crate over for them to sit on. 
		- Jonas's other affliction competes with the secomortis plague, so both are "stabilized."
	- Ria and Rem conferred, she thinks he's hiding something and is concerned. Also not sure if we'll get the rebel's writ with just one prisoner. They won't let us leave with Jonas. Rem talked about Valindra/Perse making a distraction to smuggle him out. Ria suggested that they tell him some info about trying to ingratiate themselves with the rebels in order to get what they need. 
- Lewis's sending to Perse
	- I fear the captain is interested in the Rexums artifacts. Keep Valindra and move away from the camp. thought our station was more recognized.
		- Perse response:  "He's interested because you TOLD him EVERYTHING. And now you bid me obey your ~unparalleled~ wisdom? Horse-muck, street dung, absolute imbecile. Shove your cock--"
- META: Rem, Ria, Lewis returned to confer with Aaron
	- Rem asked about what Jonas had told Aaron, not much. They conferred about Jonas's "unholy" infection. Rem thinks maybe he's consorting with an outside force not in their pantheon. Rem encouraged him to let Jonas go so that Jonas can continue to progress his work, Ria encouraged it so that Jonas would let his guard down. 
		- Aaron was troubled by the nature of the cure, considering execution.
	- Aaron spoke of what Lewis told him about our mission, Lewis was silent. Said his goal was to try and help find the cure, that's why he came out of retirement. Said the Karz sap almost killed him.
		- Rem offered to put in a word with the Rexum to retry the Karz sap cure. Aaron requested Jonas's cure isn't unholy, he wants Rem to promise to help deliver it to him, or kill Jonas if it is unholy. Aaron has about a year to live.
	- Aaron said he won't have his men raid their camp, but wants more info on the rebels, and then would allow the prisoner to "escape" in order to save face. Rem suggested that instead he release him under his custody according to the Rexum's orders. But Aaron wants a reason to continue to operate as he does.
	- Aaron said he's going to bed, in the morning he's going to do a review of the security/perimeter.
	- Ria asked for Aaron's discretion in what Lewis revealed. Aaron suggested we leave the artifact here and he can deliver it to the Rexum. Ria declined due to our orders. 
	- Rem shook Aaron's hand and told him he agreed to either try and deliver the cure to Aaron in time, or kill Jonas if he's evil.
- Rem, Ria, Lewis, and Annica walked out of the camp with the prisoners in restraints.
	- I told Valindra we should stay far back in case they're being followed. But we didn't notice anything.
	- Ria said they were able to negotiate for their release. 
- Valindra and I spoke, I urged her to use judgement and maintain secrecy. She asked about me insulting Lewis's whore of a mother. I asked about her family. She remembers flashes of her mother. She asked if I was a mother, I said once, a long time ago. My kind don't often have kids so it was a shock. I talked to her about raising corpse moths in an apiary, said maybe I would raise the party as my kids. Said I often experience boredom, would try and be a good example for her. She said she trusts me. Encouraged me to mess with others outside of the group for mischief. I hinted about her masturbating/developing feelings for the others and to let me know if she feels anything different.
- Back in the rebel camp
	- Schwarz said the rebels are going to Lena village and take Jonas with them to work on the cure there. Rem lightly told them about the situation with the Dominion being interested in the cure.
	- The rebel camp packed up to move, offered us use of the cart. We said we'd accompany them. 
- I apologized to Rem. He accepted it, asked for my sincerity, I said I would try to be more sincere. I walked with him, asked him for details. He told us everything. I told him about overhearing Lewis. Said we should talk to him.
- Lewis asked for cloaks to hide us, like rebel uniforms. We got those, a writ with the Bruder seal, and a lute.
