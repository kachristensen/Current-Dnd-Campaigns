## Notes
- Lewis's convo with Aaron
	- Aaron suggested we take out the rebels, Lewis thinks we shouldn't. He told Aaron one of them is a noble. Aaron suggested they discuss it with Rem.
- Rem's convo with Jonas
	- Jonas says he's not allied with either the rebels or the Dominion, but isn't sure about sharing it yet. Jonas wants Rem to help him escape, Rem asked for a reason to trust him/believe his cure and that he will use it to help people.
