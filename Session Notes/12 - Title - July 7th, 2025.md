## Notes
- Lewis's convo with Aaron
	- Aaron suggested we take out the rebels, Lewis thinks we shouldn't. He told Aaron one of them is a noble. Aaron suggested they discuss it with Rem.
- META: Rem's convo with Jonas
	- Jonas says he's not allied with either the rebels or the Dominion, but isn't sure about sharing it yet. Jonas wants Rem to help him escape, Rem asked for a reason to trust him/believe his cure and that he will use it to help people. Jonas asked for binds loosening, Rem moved a crate over for them to sit on. 
		- Jonas's other affliction competes with the secomortis plague, so both are "stabilized."
	- Ria and Rem conferred, she thinks he's hiding something and is concerned. Also not sure if we'll get the rebel's writ with just one prisoner. They won't let us leave with Jonas. Rem talked about Valindra/Perse making a distraction to smuggle him out.
- Lewis's sending to Perse
	- I fear the captain is interested in the Rexums artifacts. Keep Valindra and move away from the camp. thought our station was more recognized.
		- Perse response:  "He's interested because you TOLD him EVERYTHING. And now you bid me obey your ~unparalleled~ wisdom? Horse-muck, street dung, absolute imbecile. Shove your cock--"
