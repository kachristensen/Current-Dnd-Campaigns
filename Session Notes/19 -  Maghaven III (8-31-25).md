## Summary
The party encountered a newborn elder oblex who had integrated several corpses of the workers into its form, and named it Red. They slew an insectoid cultist and behir likely related to the Cult of the Broodmother, Xi'talla, and returned to the surface.

## IC Synopsis - Ria
> Sewer search resumed post-combat. Encountered a handful of gelatinous cubes in transit (no threat, eliminated or avoided without casualties). 
   Examined westward path first upon reaching the next branch in our path. Party arrived at a dead-end cistern and there found an unusual ooze. The ooze was notably capable of speech in the Common tongue (method uncertain, knowledge of other languages uncertain) and cognition. Henceforth, the creature will be referred to as “Red” per the designation assigned by Persephone. 
   Party member Persephone engaged in conversation with Red, making inquiries related to the creature responsible for killing sewage workers. Description received: “something tendril-like in the water”. Party then backtracked toward the eastward path following the conclusion of this interrogation. 
   Of note: Red claimed to have formed only recently, after consuming multiple human corpses (remains observed within its mass), which it also displayed control over. Possible capability of perceiving through controlled corpses observed but not confirmed. Specific ooze type of origin unknown. It self-reported to have absorbed memories from the human corpses, hence its apparent sapience. Possibility for collaboration noted by the party, to be reported to Mayor Sabine at earliest convenience.
   Swarming insects encountered on eastward path (dispatched with no issue), seemingly disturbed by something further in. Encountered a robed figure searching for something in a pool of water further down the path, which was immediately hostile. 
   Engagement with the figure and accompanying maggot swarms (seemingly allied) drew forth our quarry: large, reptilian creature (determined later to be a Behir) infested with parasites (control of the creature by these parasites speculated, but not confirmed). Several party members gravely injured by lightning exuded by the Behir, but no deaths. Party member Lewis collapsed briefly, but was revived by Rembrandt. Companion drake Wuffi was killed by the Behir, but magically restored later during combat by Valindra. 
   Robed figure observed capable of attacking with tentacle appendages and mental assault (magic or psionic). The party focused on its elimination first before dealing with the infested Behir. Several maggot swarms were thrown from the body of the Behir during combat, but proved largely ineffectual. Remaining parasite infestation exited the Behir’s corpse after Valindra dealt the final blow, and was destroyed by collective effort. 
   Corpse of the robed figure noted to be rapidly purifying after death. Remains still discernible bore insectoid features. Unidentified holy symbol found among the creature’s effects. Cult activity likely- additional membership in/beneath Maghaven possible but unconfirmed. Recommended/intended course of action: swift elimination upon encountering any further cultists.
   Inspected the pool of water the cultist was searching and recovered a brown, oblong object roughly three hand-lengths across. Resemblance to insect egg noted, however it was split open and contents spilled due to incidental proximity to spellwork during combat. Items recovered as proof of kill to return to Mayor Sabine: egg, Behir tooth, and cultist symbol.
   Red reappeared as the party was exiting the room, drawn by commotion. It confirmed the Behir as familiar, per absorbed memory. It demanded to absorb the remains of the cultist and Behir, but was dissuaded from this action by Persephone. It declined a suggestion to leave when asked by Rembrandt, expressing more interest in “working on its domain” and remaining in comfort. Further research of Red was suggested, and approved by the creature itself. 
   Concluding discussion, the party exited the sewers under escort by Red.

## Notes
- Voice asked "who goes there", big gooey red slime full of corpses, said this place is this home. Found rotting corpses and integrated them into his body. It has their memories as well, ambushed by something in the water, long slippery.
	- It was born only recently, used to be an ooze. Perse named it Red. It doesn't know what its purpose is. Doesn't know much, basically a newborn.
	- Perse told it not to integrate alive humans, can eat the monsters though.
	- Valindra suggested we name it Scarlet. We said we'd discuss with the mayor and have someone come talk to it again.
- We continued east, vibrating, killed swarm of insects. Cultist fishing in the water, did Mind Rot, big psychic damage, inhumanly loud shriek. Summoned a wyvern-like thing with worms burrowing in its skin
	- Defeated the cultist, wyvern, and maggots. Cultist body didn't look human, chitinous. Xchitalla? Insect-like. 
	- Strange symbol, Rem and Lewis know of it, Xi'talla
	- Mage hand + light in pool, we recovered a brownish split egg, insectoid. Red came and wanted to eat the cultist but I persuaded it not to. Rem suggested it come up out to the world above. It wanted to stay home. We elected to leave and would inform ppl to come investigate/talk with him.
