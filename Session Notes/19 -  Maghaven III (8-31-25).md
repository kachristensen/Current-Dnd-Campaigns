## Notes
- Voice asked "who goes there", big gooey red slime full of corpses, said this place is this home. Found rotting corpses and integrated them into his body. It has their memories as well, ambushed by something in the water, long slippery.
	- It was born only recently, used to be an ooze. Perse named it Red. It doesn't know what its purpose is. Doesn't know much, basically a newborn.
	- Perse told it not to integrate alive humans, can eat the monsters though.
	- Valindra suggested we name it Scarlet. We said we'd discuss with the mayor and have someone come talk to it again.
- We continued east, vibrating, killed swarm of insects. Cultist fishing in the water, did Mind Rot, big psychic damage, inhumanly loud shriek. Summoned a wyvern-like thing with worms burrowing in its skin
