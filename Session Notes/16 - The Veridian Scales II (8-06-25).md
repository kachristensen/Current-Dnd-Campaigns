## Summary


## IC Synopsis - 
>

- We found 2 wyvern and 4 more of the VS ppl near a boulder. Out of 7 total. 
	- Rem used Necrotic Shroud
	- Valindra used Etifa's heart to dominate monster the wyvern. One of the dudes mounted one and tried to flee, Valindra mounted hers and flew after it. Intense aerial combat. She managed to kill the drake.
	- The wyverns were trained mounts of the VS. 5 int. Valindra wouldn't gain anything from consuming it's heart, but she considered it. Skin - sellable but probably not good enough for armor.
	- We executed Valindra's controlled wyvern
		- Both Rem and Lewis have BI for the next hour
		- We harvested 4 doses of wyvern poison
