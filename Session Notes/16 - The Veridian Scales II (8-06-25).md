## Summary
The party slew the remaining party of Veridian Scales, then arrived at Maghaven.

## IC Synopsis - Rembrandt's Record
>The first foray with the Veridian Scales left me bruised and battered, though a short rest and Lewis’s mending magic ensured I was ready for the second bout.  Perse pestered me on the way to their camp, trying to ascertain if I wanted to smite Ria or herself.  I did my best to assure her that was not the case, when Valindra revealed she had been stalking Ria for seven years prior to our assignment together.  Perse thought it appropriate to pile on, and an understandably shaken Ria distanced herself from the other women.  I gifted Ria the flask from Otis in an attempt to comfort her, but it can hardly replace the time and space she needs.
  A welcome distraction awaited us in the Veridian Scales camp, as we nearly stumbled upon the remaining seven cultists and their two wyverns.  We acted swiftly, and despite our disputes and differences we continued to collaborate effectively in combat.  Valindra hurled her lightning javelin, Ria dropped an explosive electrical burst, and I finished off one of the enemy spellcasters in short order.  Not before I tapped into a strange form of my celestial powers, however, as black, bony wings emerged from back.  My typically golden magics were marred by a black ichor I’m none too fond of.  Perse slowed the enemy forces with temporal magic and flitted away as the Scales attempted to ambush her, while Lewis used his healing magics to keep us all upright and able.  Even with our blitz proving effective, the battle was hardly a rout.  Valindra used the Heart of Etifa to compel one of the wyverns, at which point the remaining Veridian Scales sensed the battle was lost.  One spellcaster revived another, who then tried to escape, but Perse prevented that plot from progressing with a well placed spell.  Valindra mounted her wyvern and took to the sky in pursuit of the enemy as we dispatched the remaining forces on the ground.  The two wyverns were tangled as they ascended and it was hard to see what exactly transpired in the sky, but the outcome was clear enough.  The enemy wyvern was dead before it hit the ground, but its rider was not so fortunate.
  Valindra landed nearby with her charmed wyvern as the battle concluded, and Perse jumped off Anicca to shower the elven woman with praise.  Persephone had used her teleporting magic to join me on my steed during the battle, a tactically sound decision to say nothing of my tolerance for the woman.  When she was done congratulating Valindra for her magical domination of the wyvern, she suggested the beast be put down before the effect faded.  Valindra seemed to understand, but was hesitant to do so herself and requested my aid.  I sent her off and sundered the serpent with a swift smite.  Must all mercy be so bloody?  Lewis and Valindra deemed the wyvern scales less useful than those of the young dragon we’d just faced, but their saddles were salvaged and their venom proved quite potent.  Four vials were gathered between the two wyverns as Ria searched the camp.  She found a map to a nearby dragon and mentions of a “Project Goldheart”, which seems to center on gathering dragon parts for some unknown purpose. 
  After another brief respite we continued on towards Maghaven.  Valindra asked me for riding lessons, presumably after her experience riding the wyvern left her shaken.  I can’t claim to have experience with airborne mounts, but I agreed to help her once we arrived in town.  Wuffi seemed none too pleased with his master either, perhaps out of jealousy?  I did not press the subject, instead opting to press onwards towards our destination.  We arrived at Maghaven that evening, and were greeted at the gate by several soldiers and two bladedolls.  I stepped forward to present the writ of passage and we were granted entry without any issue.  We were also provided instructions on how to meet with the mayor, and the location of an inn called the Ticking Clock.
  Towers dominated the city, and the modern structures all seemed to be made of wood, copper, and brass.  A clock tower in particular drew the eye, but we also noted a great deal of wartime propaganda depicting an industrious woman wearing glasses–Agnes Welker we’d later learn.  Ria noticed the item on her wrist in these depictions was Cirrepeti’s Scarificator, and Perse learned she had risen from a single alchemy shop to own several factories that employ a large number of Maghaven’s residents.  A popular local leader to be sure, and one we needed to meet with.  The Ticking Clock was warm and welcoming, and we secured two rooms and boarding for the night in exchange for five gold.  Perse requested a bottle of wine but balked at the ten gold asking price, leading Lewis to pay for it himself.  He offered to procure a barrel of ale as well, but I told him I’d be abstaining.  Drinking hardly seemed wise given my condition, as much as I wanted to partake.  I was quite ravenous, however, and downed several servings of bangers and mash, sausages, and whatever else was thrown my way.
  After she’d had her fill of dinner and drinks, Persephone enlisted Lewis to speak with the locals.  In particular, an attractive woman named Taryn who entered the inn shortly after we did.  They learned she was a visiting seamstress and she requested to join us during our visit to the market the following day.  Perse agreed and also inquired after having a dress made.  Hardly practical apparel, but I was not present to protest.  Ria and Valindra made for quiet company at the table, so I was left to my own thoughts.  I pondered a visit to the barber, but given the rapid growth of my hair perhaps shears would be more prudent.  When Lewis and Persephone rejoined us, we agreed to pursue two threads: a meeting with the mayor and Agnes Welker.  Lewis requested time to work on armor for me, but when he mentioned a two week timeframe my thoughts turned once more to the impending full moon and my lycanthropy.

## Notes
- We found 2 wyvern and 4 more of the VS ppl near a boulder. Out of 7 total. 
	- Rem used Necrotic Shroud
	- Valindra used Etifa's heart to dominate monster the wyvern. One of the dudes mounted one and tried to flee, Valindra mounted hers and flew after it. Intense aerial combat. She managed to kill the drake.
	- The wyverns were trained mounts of the VS. 5 int. Valindra wouldn't gain anything from consuming it's heart, but she considered it. Skin - sellable but probably not good enough for armor.
	- We executed Valindra's controlled wyvern
		- Rem has BI for the next hour
		- We harvested 4 doses of wyvern poison
		- We found a map to the black dragon's lair. Project Goldheart - they're gathering materials for it. Also found 270g and 1 revivify and 2 exotic saddles.
- Short rest otw to Maghaven. At sunset, we arrived.
	- Front gate guarded by soldiers. Rem showed them the writ that said we were trustworthy and had free passage from Schwartz Bruder.
	- Guard asked why we were here, I said trade and to stay the night. Rem and Ria said we'd seek an audience with their leader. Recommended a tavern called the Ticking Clock. Mid-range. Lots of hoity toity types.
	- Victorian style town, more modern compared to the smaller town's we've been to. Soldiers patrolling the streets at night. Propaganda posters featuring a woman with glasses and a potion, to help the war effort and recruit members, Agnes. Something on her left wrist, similar to an artifact we're on the hunt for, Cirrepeti Scarificator, a vambrace.
	- We got 2 premium suites, 5 gold a night for all of us. Dinner and wine.
	- Perse asked Rem if mounting his horse was ok, he said they were compatible in combat, she teased him about being compatible elsewhere and about the granny on the other side of the bar, letting the wolf out, he said not to joke about it.
	- Valindra suggested we find Vera and give her the dragon map. Lewis teased her about having a thing for her, she didn't know what that was, he said she doesn't know what love is. Ria doesn't think we should unless we mean to get involved. Ria suggested we slay it if it can ingratiate us with the rebels.
	- We talked to Taryn, she's a seamstress who's only been here for 2-3 days. She made her own dress. She's here for business. We're accompanying Taryn to the market tomorrow. She's a lesbian.
		- We asked around about Agnes Welker, she's an inventor, artificer, magic shop.
	- We're also going to meet with the mayor. Lewis asked about a messenger boy.
