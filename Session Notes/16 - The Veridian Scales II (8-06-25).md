## Summary


## IC Synopsis - 
>

- We found 2 wyvern and 4 more of the VS ppl near a boulder. Out of 7 total. 
	- Rem used Necrotic Shroud
	- Valindra used Etifa's heart to dominate monster the wyvern. One of the dudes mounted one and tried to flee, Valindra mounted hers and flew after it. Intense aerial combat. She managed to kill the drake.
	- The wyverns were trained mounts of the VS. 5 int. Valindra wouldn't gain anything from consuming it's heart, but she considered it. Skin - sellable but probably not good enough for armor.
	- We executed Valindra's controlled wyvern
		- Rem has BI for the next hour
		- We harvested 4 doses of wyvern poison
		- We found a map to the black dragon's lair. Project Goldheart - they're gathering materials for it. Also found 270g and 1 revivify and 2 exotic saddles.
- Short rest otw to Maghaven. At sunset, we arrived.
	- Front gate guarded by soldiers. Rem showed them the writ that said we were trustworthy and had free passage from Schwartz Bruder.
	- Guard asked why we were here, I said trade and to stay the night. Rem and Ria said we'd seek an audience with their leader. Recommended a tavern called the Ticking Clock. Mid-range. Lots of hoity toity types.
	- Victorian style town, more modern compared to the smaller town's we've been to. Soldiers patrolling the streets at night. Propaganda posters featuring a woman with glasses and a potion, to help the war effort and recruit members, Agnes. Something on her left wrist, similar to an artifact we're on the hunt for, Cirrepeti Scarificator, a vambrace.
	- We got 2 premium suites, 5 gold a night for all of us. Dinner and wine.
	- Perse asked Rem if mounting his horse was ok, he said they were compatible in combat, she teased him about being compatible elsewhere and about the granny on the other side of the bar, letting the wolf out, he said not to joke about it.
	- Valindra suggested we find Vera and give her the dragon map. Lewis teased her about having a thing for her, she didn't know what that was, he said she doesn't know what love is. Ria doesn't think we should unless we mean to get involved. Ria suggested we slay it if it can ingratiate us with the rebels. w
