- Jonas's continued conversation with Valindra
	- Lena village is where he initially set up shop, he had a lab, will probably need some aid recovering some assets
	- He was trying to get Valindra to make a decision on our behalf to help, assumed we did it to her. He assumed we told her what to do. 
	- He was ran out of town due to having the plague and experimenting with it. He needs more subjects to try his cure. He had some willing subjects initially. but it led to a lot of pain, results inconclusive--strong enough to negate secomortis. 
	- I said we would discuss it later, we'd be around Lena village at least enough to rest for a bit and he can propose payment when he knows more what the task will require
- Lena village
	- Schwarz led us to The Rusty Nail inn, keeper is Willy
		- Rem paid for us, 3g for rooms
		- Schwarz gave us 200g, said they were doing PR for Jonas
	- West side of town was under siege a few years ago, hasn't recovered since
	- Girls went out while the boys rested, we explored town, we're in a rundown area, but there's a more classy area to the south, east residential, market in the center
		- Outside of town there's a camp area for those with the plague
		- West part abandoned/ruined
		- Temple with pantheon + St. Imelda - Karz
- Next day
	- We bought Lewis plate and 1 revivify
	- Jonas's house
		- footprints, fresh blood, broken up and destroyed, once set on fire
		- busted trapdoor like something emerged from within
		- fiendish crow--doesn't look familiar with me but the rune are abyssal, meant to contain. Spoke to us somehow telepathically? Asked for its freedom from the cage and spell trapping it
		- Experimentation room, Rem also sensed a fiendish vibe from black liquid - Test Serum F. Last person to take it was Jonas himself.
		- Something from a cage burst out and ate some food, destroyed stuff. 2 dead bodies, old and rotted. One near an incinerator.
	- Crow - named Porto. He was summoned here to provide information. I suggested we join forces, wanted to be friends. He's a demon.
		- Rem wants to smite him.
		- Porto is here to find strong individuals. He was summoned to consultation to celestial plague, his blood is used to counteract. Experiments went bad, upstairs destroyed, prisoner escaped.
		- Jonas was his captor, another prisoner. The one in the cage fled a few days ago, but they've been down here for months, starving. Jonas came briefly. Porto said he could leave it to us. I asked if it was any demon blood that could help, or just his.
			- Porto has a grudge against Jonas for summoning him and holding him here.
		- Lewis said he'd let him come if I took responsibility for him. If Porto did anything, Lewis would annihilate him.
