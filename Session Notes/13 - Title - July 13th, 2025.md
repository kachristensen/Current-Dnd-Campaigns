- Jonas's continued conversation with Valindra
	- Lena village is where he initially set up shop, he had a lab, will probably need some aid recovering some assets
	- He was trying to get Valindra to make a decision on our behalf to help, assumed we did it to her. He assumed we told her what to do. 
	- He was ran out of town due to having the plague and experimenting with it. He needs more subjects to try his cure. He had some willing subjects initially. but it led to a lot of pain, results inconclusive--strong enough to negate secomortis. 
	- I said we would discuss it later, we'd be around Lena village at least enough to rest for a bit and he can propose payment when he knows more what the task will require
