#### Notes
- Meta
	- **Shasharyu Shasha** (**SHA-MEE-RA-MU** SHASHA, aka **RYU**)- alarm raised in the prison, fire. He went into the smoke, met Laedra looking for the sextant. He said he's motivated by whoever pays the most. Laedra asked him for help to bring the other 3 dueregar women who passed out from the smoke.
		- They walked back into the mine shaft past a groaning Captain Tavius. 
	- Larimar has been exploring the tunnels around the Dretch for 10 days, went invisible to avoid a construct. Smelled smoke, came across Ryu. Said "Del'rein" sent her to seek Laedra out. 
		- They retraced our steps. Larimar gave a fake name to them.
- Main Group
	- Mr. Portshire snuck off very obviously, dropped all his stuff, picked them up, left two notes. One a letter, one a painting. Srns moved off, Vali woke up Cass.
		- His letter - he doesn't want to kill a bunch of people, going to go back and save Tavius. 
	- Cass took watch with Cheria, she said she was going to take the kids and Elaine home. Small sleepy farm outside of Hillshire. 
		- Purified the rations and gave her some
	- Cass woke up Elaine for last watch. Sarannis disappeared.
	- Zephy woke up, asked Elaine where Glubbery and Sarannis had gone. Vesh'ta looked for Sarannis. 
		- Cass is the only other person who has seen that we have the sextant.
- Vesh'ta met Ryu. Escorted his group over to ours.
	- Laedra said he she met Ryu in the prison, and Larimar happened to be in the area and wanted to help.
	- We equipped them with stuff from the chest, Ryu asked for an amulet with a clock, and one with a hammer and anvil. He has a brand of the same symbol on his chest. Symbol of Thedun, god of the forge and craftsman.
	- Shasha looked at Wuddi in shock when he spoke Draconic. He denied speaking it but seemed sus.
	- Laedra and Larimar went off to speak Dwarvish, 
- I apologized to Valindra for conducting poor science, embraces were of low sample size, asked for her assistance to hold hands.
	- We did introductions. Larimar introduced herself as **Netti**. Cloaked, shrouded figure.
	- Fey - Freya the satyr, Boots the gnome, Jangle his dad. Freya is a moon druid.
- Cass's greatsword glows with moonlight, his name is Cynthia. Ryu seemed entranced with it, asked after its value. Cass said he would have to die to part with his sword. Ryu asked to see it. Blessing of the Forge didn't work because its magical, so he used it on Cass's armor. Glowed softly, looks brand new.
	- Larimar did a Tales from Beyond ability.
- Valindra shot a fire arrow into the webs, lots burned away, she resummoned Wuffi as a poison drake and her eyes turned green. Ryu cast Aid on him, Larimar, and me. Vesh'ta cast Bless on Zephy, Cass, Shasha. Freya shapeshifted into a wolf spider.
- Drake Wardens don't usually change colors, Vali seems unique.
- Freya got excited when I mentioned I was an initiate of Maiara.
- Ryu spoke in Draconic, said he wouldn't speak of his deity here. He pet Wuffi's head.
- Vesh'ta is an acolyte of a deity, she whispered to me (but really loudly cuz failed) Zavran, the god of vengeance. She seeks vengeance on behalf of House Baneth, always.
- I asked Cass about his relationship with Eidyn, he swore his oath until death. "Balance before all. We preserve life and death. Must guide the dying. Protect the lost and abandoned." Said the undead and elves immortality mock Eidyn's tenants.
