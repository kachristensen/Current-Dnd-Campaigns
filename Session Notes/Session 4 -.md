	- **Shasharyu Shasha** (**SHA-MEE-RA-MU** SHASHA, aka **RYU**)- alarm raised in the prison, fire. He went into the smoke, met Laedra looking for the sextant.

		- They walked back into the mine shaft past a groaning Captain Tavius. 
	- Larimar has been exploring the tunnels around the Dretch for 10 days, went invisible to avoid a construct. Smelled smoke, came across Ryu. Said "Del'rein" sent her to seek Laedra out.
