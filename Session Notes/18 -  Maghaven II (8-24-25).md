## Notes
- I asked if Lewis's mother survived, she died of starvation. This was when he was a younger man. Town he was from = **Vineroff**, southern town. He thinks he's weak, after the power with the artifact. Wants guidance, a god can give him answers and power. I told him he was selling himself short, has an inferiority complex, compared him to a highly eligible bachelor, told him to talk to the others before he made a decision. He handed me my new finished face plate and we thanked each other for our kindness.
- Lady Sabine Clawthorne = the Mayor
	- Has an eyepatch on her right eye, black hair in a bun, hot. Has a fully armored guard in one corner.
