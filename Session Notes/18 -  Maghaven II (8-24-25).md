## Notes
- I asked if Lewis's mother survived, she died of starvation. This was when he was a younger man. Town he was from = **Vineroff**, southern town. He thinks he's weak, after the power with the artifact. Wants guidance, a god can give him answers and power. I told him he was selling himself short, has an inferiority complex, compared him to a highly eligible bachelor, told him to talk to the others before he made a decision. He handed me my new finished face plate and we thanked each other for our kindness.
- Lady Sabine Clawthorne = the Mayor
	- Has an eyepatch on her right eye, black hair in a bun, hot. Has a fully armored guard in one corner.
	- Asked how we were recommended by Captain Schwarz, Ria explained us rescuing Connor and the other soldiers from the imperials. Introduced herself as Lady Drakesbane, said she's here to take stock of the rebels and see if their cause are worth supporting. Concerned if history would repeat itself (the Rexum being a former rebellion leader too).
		- Sabine asked what she can do to get Ria on her side. Ria asked about Agnes Belkner, Sabine explained the machines are keeping their war effort going. Agnes is eccentric and has become extremely rich, egotistical. 
		- Sabine could arrange for us to meet at a council meeting, we could arrive as guests, but needs to also evaluate Ria of her worth. Asked us to assist in a matter.
			- One option - underbelly, a lot of sewer workers reported odd noises, gone missing. Find the source of the chaos and deal with it. Personal favor.
			- Other option - go after the adult black dragon nearby. Prestige.
	- We decided to go for the sewers first, after our business we may swing after the Dragon later.
		- They employ gelatinous cubes in the sewers. She gave us the general area to start looking in. Molly will join us to let us in, she is the key, skeleton key capabilities. They recommend 10 ft poles. She gave us a map of the sewers. Mechanicals don't function well in the sewers, corrosion. Give Molly a piece of paper to have her under our control.
	- I mentioned introducing her to Taryn, she said my dress looks similar to a dress to the most popular tailor in Maghaven. Gideon Montigue. Lady Sabine is currently wearing his work. I said I would do some investigating and get back to her on the nature of the dress. Stolen? Copied?
- We returned to the pub
	- Lewis, Valindra and I joined Taryn, I mentioned we showed off her work. She feigned knowing who the mayor was. She said her designs were originals, Taryn said she was a special savant. She seems like she is trying to play us, feigning cluelessness and innocence that her works resemble Gideon. 
	- I took Lewis to Valindra and my room, we failed an investigation check. Lewis told me she was lying, I figured I would continue to bluff with her.
	- META: Downstairs Taryn talked with Valindra, asked why she doesn't dress up as much, asked why Valindra still hid what's around her neck again. She cast suggestion on Valindra to suggest she wear it on the outside (dc 16). Valindra failed it.
- We visited Gideon Montigue, he had met Lady Taryn yesterday. This person seems under her finger. Charmed. I pulled Gideon aside. 
	- Lewis and Taryn talked. She took his measurements, asked if he and I were suspicious of her.
