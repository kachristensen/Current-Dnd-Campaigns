## Notes
- I asked if Lewis's mother survived, she died of starvation. This was when he was a younger man. Town he was from = Vineroff, southern town. He thinks he's weak, after the power with the artifact. Wants guidance, a god can give him answers and power. I told him he was selling himself short.
