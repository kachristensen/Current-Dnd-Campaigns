## Notes
- I asked if Lewis's mother survived, she died of starvation. This was when he was a younger man. Town he was from = **Vineroff**, southern town. He thinks he's weak, after the power with the artifact. Wants guidance, a god can give him answers and power. I told him he was selling himself short, has an inferiority complex, compared him to a highly eligible bachelor, told him to talk to the others before he made a decision. He handed me my new finished face plate and we thanked each other for our kindness.
- Lady Sabine Clawthorne = the Mayor
	- Has an eyepatch on her right eye, black hair in a bun, hot. Has a fully armored guard in one corner.
	- Asked how we were recommended by Captain Schwarz, Ria explained us rescuing Connor and the other soldiers from the imperials. Introduced herself as Lady Drakesbane, said she's here to take stock of the rebels and see if their cause are worth supporting. Concerned if history would repeat itself (the Rexum being a former rebellion leader too).
		- Sabine asked what she can do to get Ria on her side. Ria asked about Agnes Belkner, Sabine explained the machines are keeping their war effort going. Agnes is eccentric and has become extremely rich, egotistical. 
		- Sabine could arrange for us to meet at a council meeting, we could arrive as guests, but needs to also evaluate Ria of her worth. Asked us to assist in a matter.
			- One option - underbelly, a lot of sewer workers reported odd noises, gone missing. Find the source of the chaos and deal with it. Personal favor.
			- Other option - go after the adult black dragon nearby. Prestige.
	- We decided to go for the sewers first, after our business we may swing after the Dragon later.
		- They employ gelatinous cubes in the sewers. She gave us the general area to start looking in.
