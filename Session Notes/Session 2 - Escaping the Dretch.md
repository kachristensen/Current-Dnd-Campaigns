###### Day 1 (2/19/25)

#### Summary


#### Notes
- I spoke to Laedra about setting aside her feud with Sarannis. Cass gave the sword to Valindra.
- Cass called Samuel over, said Taevus was drunk. We knocked Samuel out and got his spear. Started opening more cells of civilians. 
	- Sarannis threatened to kill all the civilians if they made noise, I shushed them and told them we would free them.
