###### Day 1 (2/19/25)

#### Summary


#### Notes
- I spoke to Laedra about setting aside her feud with Sarannis. Cass gave the sword to Valindra.
- Cass called Samuel over, said Taevus was drunk. We knocked Samuel out and got his spear. Started opening more cells of civilians. 
	- Sarannis threatened to kill all the civilians if they made noise, I shushed them and told them we would free them.
	- We drew more guards, keys that we have don't work on the equipment room.
	- Valindra chanted in Draconic, "Come to my aid my dear friend" and her drakewarden appeared. It grabbed the warning horn in the room and fled back to us. Iridescent purple drake.
	- Sarannis firebolted past Valindra's face, she startled again. Seems startled by fire near her face.
	- I kept assisting Cass to strike the guards, we accidentally killed one with a crit.
	- Mr. Portshire got the lock stuck/jammed.
