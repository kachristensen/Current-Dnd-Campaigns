###### Day 1 (2/19/25)

#### Summary


#### Notes
- I spoke to Laedra about setting aside her feud with Sarannis. Cass gave the sword to Valindra.
- Cass called Samuel over, said Taevus was drunk. We knocked Samuel out and got his spear. Started opening more cells of civilians. 
	- Sarannis threatened to kill all the civilians if they made noise, I shushed them and told them we would free them.
	- We drew more guards, keys that we have don't work on the equipment room.
	- Valindra chanted in Draconic, "Come to my aid my dear friend" and her drakewarden appeared. It grabbed the warning horn in the room and fled back to us. Iridescent purple drake.
	- Sarannis firebolted past Valindra's face, she startled again. Seems startled by fire near her face.
	- I kept assisting Cass to strike the guards, we accidentally killed one with a crit.
	- Mr. Portshire got the lock stuck/jammed.
- Door opened, Captain Wayne came out and commanded us to return to our cells. Valindra attacked him with fire infusion from her drake.
	- Sarannis lock picked the equipment room, there's a red drake with a woman in armor. Red eyes, purple hair. Mischevous sly smile. Has a horn next to her.
	- Captain Wayne hit Valindra with a huge blow.
	- Cassander seems to have a distaste for drakes/dragons, "what a cruel jape."
	- I stepped defensively in front of Valindra, took a hit for her.
	- Sarannis killed Captain Wayne by grabbing him by the throat and slamming him, shocking grasp.
	- I ran into the equipment room and broke down the barricade, dodged their attacks, engaged 
	- Valindra spoke Draconic to try and persuade the warden and her dragon Kato to stand down, she hesitated, some sort of significance to Valindra's hair being in a ponytail?
	- I spoke in Draconic to the Warden, pulled down my hood, held out a hand to her. Beseeched her to be allies, we weren't in her way. She says we can't interfere with her post. Valindra looked at her, said it wouldn't be the first time she fought one in "our" rank. 
	- We Mexican stand-offed, she grappled me, Valindra trying to stop her.
	- Portshire started a fire.
	- I told her my name and how old I was, said I'd never known a day of freedom in my life, asked if she was ok with letting us out of the room and giving us our things and her name, Warden Blackthistle. She said yes but Cass attacked her.
		- Valindra tried to free me, Blackthistle stabbed me. Portshire stabilized me, Cheria healed me, and Sarannis nat 20 yanked me out into his arms. 
		- Mr. Portshire tried to use a key that didn't fit the lock on the equipment chest, it triggered a flame trap.
	- Valindra's drake's name is Wuffi. He broke the lock on the chest.
	- Mr. Portshire looks to Sarannis for guidance. He tried to open the chest but it doesn't seem to open it.
	- Sarannis firebolted Warden Blackthistle and killed her. Her drake collapsed and started dying when its master did. Cass stabbed it in the head as it was dying.
		- He looted her. Some money. Note - orders that the warden is to stay inside the equipment room to oversee the protection of a sextant that was brought 4 weeks ago,
