- Preemptive - see  [[What You've Learned So Far...(Zephyra) (1).pdf]]
	- upper exit more heavily guarded
	- Captain Tavius holds the keys. He is typically seated outside the cellblock at a wooden table, keeping the peace if prisoners act up. You've noticed he's been overly fond of alcohol recently and has been pulling Cass aside on more than one occasion.
	- META: Cass was able to recover a spellbook page for Sarannis to recast Find Familiar, but he got caught again
- Just before wake up - Sarannis and Cheria are missing, dragged away in the middle of the night
	- Introductions
		- Cass - dirty, straggly, long beard. Asked Joe where Sarannis is.
		- Girl cell wasn't sure where Cheria went. I told Valindra I would repay her and Cheria for their kindness. She was very optimistic.
	- Interrogation Chamber META:
		- Sarannis and Cheria being tortured/beaten. He's been getting the worst of it, tried to keep the attention on himself. Samuel is the guard thats beating them. Sarannis threatened to tell the other guards that Samuel fell asleep on his shift, he's already on probation.
	- Guard Ulf waking up the cell block 
		- Solitary confinement cell - deep groan
		- Prisoners
			- Heinrich drunkard man, Laedra female duegar, Sebastian tiefling quiet and frantic ushering a whimpering halfling boy, female drow noticed Sarannis's absence. 
			- Tension between Big Papa Joe and guard Ulf, who tries to trip him.
			- Guard Ulf doesn't even glance at the solitary confinement, that guy is getting left behind. I asked Ulf why, he said if he started to work we'd all be dead.
			- Other cells full of sad hopeless prisoners. Cheria and Sarranis joined us, battered and bruised. Cheria noticed the halfling boy's hand has started to heal but he's looking ill and feverish and infected/diseased.
			- I asked why S/C were gone, he said they were tortured, he was trying to escape. Both of them are magicians, S's familiar. I asked why they weren't being made useful.
				- Cheria grew up on a farm.
				- S made a comment about Vali's people stealing strength, she said it was her own. Sarannis did a distraction, got into a tussle with Laedra, Cass healed Peter the halfling child. 
		- Mining demand has increased lately, as if Imperium is requiring more materials for something
		- Mr Portshire is smelly, seemed to be staring at the spit on Sarannis's foot.
- Mining - warforged supervisors, gold
	- I told the girls we should try and get closer to Sarannis. Elaine seemed to be a bit aloof from me, said I was an unknown, I prodded for deeper reasons, she said she knew more about the others, I said that would be useful, she shied away and took Cheria with her.
	- Sarannis told Mr. Portshire he was strong and tried to recruit him for an escape. Portshire nodded and grunted, spat out some food, cleared out his throat. Aussie accent, can finally talk. He got down and slurped the spit off of Sarannis's boot.
		- His people believe not to waste moisture. He's a little fish cutie
	- Couple people nat 20'd mining, will get an extra ration later
	- Cass said there are more ppl in the evidence room because of Laedra. Laedra very racist to drow. She brought something very important to the evidence room.
	- I talked with Serannis, his cell mates are also interested in escaping. We know he's in for murder but thats it. I said we would talk later tonight during the evening shift.
	- Mr. Portshire said Sebastian the tiefling was a friend of his. Sebastian has been telling him a lot cuz Ptshr couldn't speak. Mr. Portshire's dad's name is Mister, his name is Glubbory Portshire. He asked if we were with Vali, the beautiful bombshell. 
	- Sebastian has a file. Portshire has a different voice, this is his common voice. Portshire gave Cheria the file. 
	- Mr. Portshire - Sebastian mentioned a heist of a ruby, Portshire said yeah everything is true, sus. There is a clock in the cell block so we can tell time. I told them to shut up and we would talk later at night. 
- Lunch
	- Cass purifying the food, Sarannis used a distraction to accuse Laedra of taking more, but failed to convince the warforged guards. They make a move to grab Sarannis but the female drow started yelling at the dueregar. She swung at Laedra. Drow picked up a rock and started bashing Laedra's kneecaps. The other 3 duegar pulled her off, the warforged separated them and picked them up and escorted them away.
		- Zephyra took their extra rations, ate an extra portion. Sarannis gave some to the kids. Said Veshta, the female drow, would probably give her food to him. She's from a lesser house. 
		- Portshire also gave the kids some food. 
	- Heinrich approached Cass for his daily supply. Grizzled older mercenary. Cass gave him some booze. Heinrich is an alcoholic. Threatened to rat Cass out, but Cass was unphased. Gave him 2 oz.
	- I asked why Sarannis gave the kids an extra portion, he said he was recently orphaned and felt bad for them. I said they were the least capable and that he ought to put the resources towards helping them escape.
	- Valindra took stock of the guards.
	- Girl chat without Elaine -- Cheria said she left her grandson behind, worrying about his safety. I told her she didn't need to mediate. Cheria said she is a magical healer, divine. I asked why they were nice to me, they said just cuz, I told them I would repay them. Cheria asked if any of the boys had caught my eye, I was confused, said I hadn't really been around men before. She teased me a bit. Valindra said she also hadn't.
	- META: Mr. Portshire's big for his people. He asked Sarannis if he had a mate, he said drow of House Dhu'unar don't get to pick their mates. Mr. Portshire said he robbed from the Emperor and that's why he's in prison.
	- I got one level of exhaustion.
- Back in our cells for dinner
	- The drow lady Veshta got punished.
	- I poked Elaine in the face. She said she can sense divine energy off Cheria and Cass. She doesn't seem to trust elves. Said they scorn the natural balance. Valindra doesn't agree with what her people are doing. I kept pressing her, said I'm human but different.
	- Sarrannis said Eidyn turned away from him, Portshire asked how Cass can lose his arm but still be blessed.
	- Boy discussion - there's additional guards in the security room. The boys have stuff in there they need. We can hear Sarannis talking - he has a spellbook they need to recover. Cass doesn't want to free the guy in solitary. Sarannis doesn't want to free the dueregar or else they will fight. Portshire encouraged him to set aside their differences just to escape.
	- We got dinner, the guy in solitary didn't.
	- Serannis summoned his raven, Jericho. Black bird, six red eyes. We planned by talking to him.
	- Valindra said there is a Scalewarden here. The elite guards of the Empire. Valindra can sense it. 
	- The Underdark is called the Deep. I said I didn't want to go back, I'm familiar with the tunnels. Sarannis is also against going down there. I said no killing if possible.
	- Captain Tavius visited. Spoke with Cass, said he would maybe take his offer. Tavius will be back in a few hours to outfit him with an arm or something.
	- Cass gave us some wine, potato moonshine, delicious. Valindra refused to drink it. I gave Cheria some. We threw it back to the boys. 
	- I told the girls where the exit was. Elaine whispered to Cheria, she can put them to sleep with magic if we want.
- Captain Tavius returned to take Cass, had a keyring with 6 keys. 
	- META: Cass played card games with the 2 guards. Asked about the Scalewarden. Anders warned him against asking, Gartilden wanted to know who was talking about it. Said he'd keep it down low. There are more visitors in the prison.
	- Tavius returned with a crude prosthetic, took Cass aside. He's an alcoholic. Says Captain Wayne has been pressuring them with a new legion. 
	- Mr Portshire has a -4 in stealth.
	- I shoved Tavius into the cell, we jumped him, I took the keys over, we unlocked our door. Cass grabbed his great sword. Valindra flinched at firebolt.
