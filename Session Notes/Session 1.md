- Preemptive - see  [[What You've Learned So Far...(Zephyra) (1).pdf]]
	- upper exit more heavily guarded
	- Captain Tavius holds the keys. He is typically seated outside the cellblock at a wooden table, keeping the peace if prisoners act up. You've noticed he's been overly fond of alcohol recently and has been pulling Cass aside on more than one occasion.
	- META: Cass was able to recover a spellbook page for Sarannis to recast Find Familiar, but he got caught again
- Just before wake up - Sarannis and Cheria are missing, dragged away in the middle of the night
	- Introductions
		- Cass - dirty, straggly, long beard. Asked Joe where Sarannis is.
		- Girl cell wasn't sure where Cheria went. I told Valindra I would repay her and Cheria for their kindness. She was very optimistic.
	- Interrogation Chamber META:
		- Sarannis and Cheria being tortured/beaten. He's been getting the worst of it, tried to keep the attention on himself. Samuel is the guard thats beating them. Sarannis threatened to tell the other guards that Samuel fell asleep on his shift, he's already on probation.
	- Guard Ulf waking up the cell block 
		- Solitary confinement cell - deep groan
		- Prisoners
			- Heinrich drunkard man, Laedra female duegar, Sebastian tiefling quiet and frantic ushering a whimpering halfling boy, female drow noticed Sarannis's absence. 
			- Tension between Big Papa Joe and guard Ulf, who tries to trip him.
			- Guard Ulf doesn't even glance at the solitary confinement, that guy is getting left behind. I asked Ulf why, he said if he started to work we'd all be dead.
			- Other cells full of sad hopeless prisoners. Cheria and Sarranis joined us, battered and bruised. Cheria noticed the halfling boy's hand has started to heal but he's looking ill and feverish and infected/diseased.
			- I asked why S/C were gone, he said they were tortured, he was trying to escape. Both of them are magicians, S's familiar. I asked why they weren't being made useful.
				- Cheria grew up on a farm.
				- S made a comment about Vali's people stealing strength, she said it was her own. Sarannis did a distraction, got into a tussle with Laedra, Cass healed Peter the halfling child. 
		- Mining demand has increased lately, as if Imperium is requiring more materials for something
		- Mr Portshire is smelly, seemed to be staring at the spit on Sarannis's foot.
- Mining - warforged supervisors, gold
	- I told the girls we should try and get closer to Sarannis. Elaine seemed to be a bit aloof from me, said I was an unknown, I prodded for deeper reasons, she said she knew more about the others, I said that would be useful, she shied away and took Cheria with her.
	- Sarannis told Mr. Portshire he was strong and tried to recruit him for an escape. Portshire nodded and grunted, spat out some food, cleared out his throat. Aussie accent, can finally talk. He got down and slurped the spit off of Sarannis's boot.
		- His people believe not to waste moisture. He's a little fish cutie
	- Couple people nat 20'd mining, will get an extra ration later
	- Cass said there are more ppl in the evidence room because of Laedra. Laedra very racist to drow. She brought something very important to the evidence room.
	- I talked with Serannis, his cell mates are also interested in escaping. We know he's in for murder but thats it. I said we would talk later tonight during the evening shift.
	- Mr. Portshire said Sebastian the tiefling was a friend of his. Sebastian has been telling him a lot cuz Ptshr couldn't speak. Mr. Portshire's dad's name is Mister, his name is Glubbory Portshire. He asked if we were with Vali, the beautiful bombshell. 
	- Sebastian has a file. Portshire has a different voice, this is his common voice. Portshire gave Cheria the file. 
	- Mr. Portshire - Sebastian mentioned a heist of a ruby, Portshire said yeah everything is true, sus. There is a clock in the cell block so we can tell time. I told them to shut up and we would talk later at night. 
- Lunch
	- Cass purifying the food, Sarannis used a distraction to accuse Laedra of taking more, but failed to convince the warforged guards. They make a move to grab Sarannis but the female drow started yelling at the dueregar. She swung at Laedra. Drow picked up a rock and started bashing Laedra's kneecaps. The other 3 duegar pulled her off, the warforged separated them and picked them up and escorted them away.
		- Zephyra took their extra rations, ate an extra portion. Sarannis gave some to the kids. Said Veshta, the female drow, would probably give her food to him. She's from a lesser house. 
		- Portshire also gave the kids some food. 
	- Heinrich approached Cass for his daily supply. Grizzled older mercenary. Cass gave him some booze. Heinrich is an alcoholic. Threatened to rat Cass out, but Cass was unphased. Gave him 2 oz.
	- I asked why he gave the kids
