	- upper exit more heavily guarded
	- Captain Tavius holds the keys. He is typically seated outside the cellblock at a wooden table, keeping the peace if prisoners act up. You've noticed he's been overly fond of alcohol recently and has been pulling Cass aside on more than one occasion.
	- META: Cass was able to recover a spellbook page for Sarannis to recast Find Familiar, but he got caught again
- Just before wake up - Sarannis and Cheria are missing, dragged away in the middle of the night
	- Introductions
		- Cass - dirty, straggly, long beard. Asked Joe where Sarannis is.
		- Girl cell wasn't sure where Cheria went. I told Valindra I would repay her and Cheria for their kindness. She was very optimistic.
	- Interrogation Chamber META:
		- Sarannis and Cheria being tortured/beaten. He's been getting the worst of it, tried to keep the attention on himself. Samuel is the guard thats beating them. Sarannis threatened to tell the other guards that Samuel fell asleep on his shift, he's already on probation.
	- Guard Ulf waking up the cell block 
		- Solitary confinement cell - deep groan
		- Prisoners
			- Heinrich drunkard man, Laedra female duegar, Sebastian tiefling quiet and frantic ushering a whimpering halfling boy, female drow noticed Sarannis's absence. 
			- Tension between Big Papa Joe and guard Ulf, who tries to trip him.
			- Guard Ulf doesn't even glance at the solitary confinement, that guy is getting left behind. I asked Ulf why, he said if he started to work we'd all be dead.
			- Other cells full of sad hopeless prisoners. Cheria and Sarranis joined us, battered and bruised. Cheria noticed the halfling boy's hand has started to heal but he's looking ill and feverish and infected/diseased.
			- I asked why S/C were gone, he said they were tortured, he was trying to escape. Both of them are magicians, S's familiar. I asked why they weren't being made useful.
				- Cheria grew up on a farm.
				- S made a comment about Vali's people stealing strength, she said it was her own.
