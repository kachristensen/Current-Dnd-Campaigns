###### Days 13-14

![[13 Jonas's Lab.jpg|center]]

## Summary
The party slew the monstrously transformed Jonas with melted silver, questioned his corpse, re-inspected his lab, and questioned Porto. Lewis and Persephone shared a heated argument as he tried to kill Porto. Rem was infected with lycanthropy, and the party discussed pursuing a cure, then headed forward to Maghaven in the morning.

## IC Synopsis - Lewis

>The air was thick with tension as the ground trembled under Joonas' monstrous form. His transformation complete, the corrupted werewolf loomed before them, claws glistening with malice. Rem strode forward, greatsword in hand, eyes locked on the abomination.
  "Is this your true form?" Rem muttered with a crooked grin, steel already swinging through the air.
  The blade cleaved into Jonas with a roar of impact—no holding back, no mercy. Flesh tore and blood sprayed. Before the beast could recover, Valindra lunged with her spear, striking with precision and fury, carving through sinew like a dancer through shadow. The two warriors cut deep, but Joonas retaliated in a blur, claws slashing wildly at Rem, staggering him.
  Lewis rushed forward, desperately trying to keep Rem on his feet with a healing spell, but the ground quaked as Jonas leapt into the air. With devastating force, he crashed down, sending Rem, Valindra, and Lewis tumbling to the earth in a heap.
  Persephone raised her hand and cast her magic, Sticking at Jonas’s mind—but it fizzled. The werewolf was resisting everything.
  Ria's eyes narrowed. Her form shimmered, crackling with energy as she entered her full damage form. She unleashed a glowing Flaming sphere, slamming into Jonas and forcing him back.
  Gritting his teeth, Rem pushed himself up from the rubble, a healing glow wrapping around his wounds. With a war cry of defiance, he charged once more, striking with relentless might. Valindra was beside him again, her spear a blur, pressing the attack with precision.
  But Jonas, not finished yet, swiped with a massive claw at Valindra  as Perse with a silvery barbs distraction. The distraction allowed Valindra just enough time to dodge—but only barely. A deep gash still bloomed across her shoulder.
  Lewis, unfazed, summoned his Aura of Vitality, radiant energy pulsing outward to shield and mend his allies. Yet Jonas was on the move again—his massive frame leaping across the battlefield—landing a brutal critical strike on Valindra that sent her reeling.
  Perse tried to stop him, voice sharp with authority. “Kneel before your Queen!” she commanded.
  But the monster was too far gone. He pushed through her words like wind, rage blinding him.
  Ria struck again—Shocking Grasp lancing through Jonas’s hide, amplified by the lingering energy of her sphere. Sparks danced across the beast’s form.
  With coordinated fury, Valindra and Rem struck in unison—steel and spear meeting flesh in a final, fatal crescendo. Jonas fell to his knees, growling, blood pouring from a dozen wounds.
  But he would not die quietly.
  Perse tossed a set of coils to Lewis—silver.  Understanding instantly, Lewis heated them with Heat Metal, melting them into molten death. He poured the searing liquid down onto Jonas’s mouth, burning through fur, flesh, and bone. The beast shrieked... then was silent.
  But not all eyes were on Jonas. During the chaos, Portos had tried something—something on Valindra. Perse caught it, her voice cutting through the clash: “What the hell do you think you’re doing, Portos?”
  The tension sizzled, even as victory loomed.
  And as the other werewolves laid there unconscious. Rem turned with unshakable calm. With an ironic flair fitting only of him, he dispatched the last of them—not with blade nor fire—but with a silver dildo,Presephone made, swung with irreverent precision. The battlefield was quiet again. Smoke. Blood. Victory
  We returned back to Jonas’s lab and discovered Rem is now cursed with lycanthropy. I craft two silver daggers, research a lycanthropy cure (finds it inconclusive), and use holy water on Rem’s cursed wound. The full moon is in 18 days, pressing the urgency of Rem’s condition. I also consider trading his soul or life to save Rem.
  Rem speaks with the dead (Jonas), learns of a demon named Mastenovti Joonas worked with, and has a dream about running on all fours. He begins growing a beard, hinting at his transformation. As well revealed to have created Sample F, the last remnant of his lycanthropy cure research. No other living person knows about it.
  Persephone seeks information on demon summoning and shows interest in probing Portos for knowledge.  Portos (a quasit) serves one of four major demons and was created during the Age of Ash. He hints the "Old Ones" will rise again. He had tried to probe Valindra for leverage during the fight.
  Lewis attacks Portos with Guiding Bolt as the quasit leaves. Persephone is extremely upset with this and questions me on my morals as well as my unthinking actions.
  We travel on the next day pushing away from the city

## Notes
- Jonas turned into a massive demon lycanthrope thing, it regens. Blood frenzy. 
	- Porto cast something on Valindra mid combat, Detect Thoughts.
	- Requires silver to kill. I gave Lewis 5 silver coins and told him to heat metal, he liquified it into Jonas's mouth.
	- Rem was bit on his shoulder and infected with lycanthropy. Lewis can't help yet. 
	- I took the silver out of Jonas's throat and handed it to Rem to kill the remaining lycanthropes. 
- We headed back to the lab.  
	- Remove curse - requires being done under a full moon, DC 17 constitution. 18 days until the next full moon.
	- I took his grimoires about demon kind, mostly legends about them being violent lords, and the dragons destroying them. Rumors that the demons went underground after. To summon them, you must perform a ritual, blood sacrifice, will let you contact a higher level demon. I took all grimoires mentioning anything about it. 
	- Lewis tossed some holy water on Rem. Rem put himself in a cage. Rem cast Speak with Dead on Jonas.
		- Is there a cure to your strain?
			- Inconclusive.
		- Who were you working with in relation to Porto?
			- A demon named Mastenovti.
				- What I know - during the Demonic Age, he was one of the more powerful demon lords. Probably escaped and went underground. 
		- Is there more of your serum or research hidden elsewhere?
			- Sample F is a direct sample to infect himself, it's the only one.
		- What does Mastenovti get out of their deal?
			- He didn't say, but he asked that Jonas return to him after successfully finding a cure. 
		- Does anyone else know what you've done here or of your cure?
			- Those who know of his cure have been infected with it, or have passed.
	- Porto
		- Mastenovti desires to create soldiers to retake what is theirs. He + 3 Demon lords are left, I got their names.
		- I asked if Porto was alive during the demonic age. He said no. He was created during the Age of Ash. I asked if he was a quasit, he said yes, somewhat unique. 
		- Connection to the abyss is still tenuous, the ancient demons grow old. 
		- I asked if Porto wanted to serve me, he said no, when the demons take over he will be rewarded from Mastenovti.
		- Valindra said the dragons would rise to stop them.
		- Porto wants to know what Valindra desires and wants. 
		- Valindra asked if Mastenovti had come into any recent artifacts, I downplayed it.
		- I asked Porto in Abyssal why I am here, he said "Curious. Could get answer, but need something in return." Asked us to work for his master, he could give us 
		- He asked for something to find us all with. I handed him one of Mel's scales. 
		- Lewis tried to guiding bolt him, it hit but he survived. I tried to silvery barbs. We had an extremely heated conversation. I tried to persuade Lewis that demons weren't all evil, Lewis didn't care. Said he would shoot the next one I talked to immediately.
	- I dissected Jonas. He was rotting on the inside. No secomortis plague.
- Valindra asked Rem why he shoved Jonas. Bc Jonas was a liability, was going to burst into a rage. 
	- I asked if Rem wanted me to inform Aaron of what we found. He said sure.
	- Rem doesn't want to leave. I told him we should leave for somewhere less populated. I told him he will be ok, I can help manage his emotions, he'll have to let me in, I won't do anything without his consent.
	- We stayed the night. Rem stayed in the cell. Valindra and I kept watch, I stayed in the cell too.
	- We incinerated the bodies.
- Night
	- We long rested, Valindra and I kept watch. 
		- Rem had a dream. Urge to run, on all fours. Feels right, like it's always been natural.
		- Rem's hair has grown an inch and he has an inch of facial hair.
	- I sent Lord Aaron a message about Jonas's cure and let him know we killed him and destroyed it. He gave his approval.
- I talked to Rem in the morning.
	- Asked what he senses on me, faintly fiendish. Now he also senses it on himself, conflicting with the celestial.
	- Lewis cast Remove Curse on Rem, nothing happened. Told him to wait until the full moon. Said he would take care of Rem, he wasn't going to lose anyone. 
	- I talked to Lewis in the morning, said Demons are capable of change. Lewis apologized for being brash. Also thinking about the hand. He said he would take my words into consideration. I asked about the hand, if he made a decision about it. Lewis feels guilty about not using the hand, maybe he could have prevented the outcome of the fight, Rem getting infected.
	- I smacked Lewis on the shoulder and cheered him up, encouraged him that we would be okay. Rem also agreed. As did Ria. We told him he didn't need the hand.
