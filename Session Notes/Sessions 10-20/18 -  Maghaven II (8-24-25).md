###### Day 15

![[17 Maghaven.jpg | center]]

## Summary
The party accepted Mayor Sabine's mission to investigate strange occurrences in Maghaven's sewers in exchange for being invited to a council meeting and meet Agnes. After confronting Taryn and dispelling her enchantment on a tailor, Taryn revealed she was sent by a god to investigate them, then teleported out. The party entered the sewers and began slaying aberrations.

## IC Synopsis - Valindra
> I... Have made some mistakes. Ria, has been avoiding me since she learned of my protecting her all these years. I thought, I thought I was doing what I was supposed to. But Persephone pointed out how much wrong I have done. Maybe I can talk to Ria in a few days and set things right. 
   Lord Sajj’aka… this path you put me on it is, becoming harder to see it clearly. I am not even sure if it is the right way anymore…
   Oh? Persephone needs a distraction! I can take care of that!
   This doll seems like the type to answer when spoken to, perhaps I can ask her about Maghaven… And the weather…. And the food…. They sure are taking quite some time for what ever they needed to do.
   Thankfully that did not last much longer, as Lewis came to me to signal, they were done. Just in time as our appointment with the mayor was come due. 
   The mayor greeted us from her desk, a one Sabine Clawthorne. Behind her a heavily armored guard who did not speak. Sabine match’s Persephone’s number of eyes but she is covered by a patch.
   Sabine asks us our business and surprising Ria takes lead speaking with her, even without her glasses. Which seemed to go well as Ria’s noble Drakesbane name seems to be doing well for us. We learn that Agnes’ rise to fame was quite fast, but the fame did not sit well with the woman. Ria convinces the mayor quite well that she would like to learn more of Agnes to see it is worth Ria joining the rebellion. It honestly is quite impressive to watch her work, she does so well in this interactions, it rivals her skill with magic.
   Sabine is incline to assist us but wants to test us herself. Offering two issues plaguing her city. The first of the issues, the adult dragon that we already learned of from Vera. The other issue, which seemed to be Sabine’s more pressing matter, was reports of disturbances in the sewers below.
   We discussed this together. Personally, I was more inclined to find this dragon. After our last encounter with the younger green one, I am interested in learning more of this adult one. Perhaps a chance to converse with it. It also intrigues me to speak with Vera again. She was… interesting and I would like to learn more of her. But as we talked it made the most sense to assist the mayor with her sewers. Her favor would do us better. 
   The mayor seems happy with our choice to help her, and provides us more information. Such that the mechanical soldiers they have cannot operate down there due to the water rusting them. Perhaps that could be helpful to know in the future if we need to fight them. As well as creatures they have intentionally used to clean the sewers themselves. Best to watch out for them.
   Heading back to the tavern we meet up with Taryn who we had told we were going to go shopping with. I went in with Persephone and Lewis to collect her and chatted. Lewis and Persephone headed to our room for a moment while I was left to speak further with Taryn. Again, she was pushy with the necklace I am wearing. Trying to encourage me to display it. I again explained to her the issues with such an item and swinging around long glaives and halberds. In what seemed like a sterner suggestion, that left my head aching, she again told me to display it where I declined once more.
   With Persephone’s lead we headed to a famous tailor of these parts to introduce Taryn to him. The two seemed to already know one another. A Gideon Montaque was his name. He left for the back with Persephone and Rem while Lewis and Ria spoke with Taryn. Taking the time, I looked about at the wares. To Taryn’s suggestion about wearing some clothing that is more… casual. A skirt here, a dress there. Vibrant colors. None of these would do me well in a fight. These colors alone I would stick out from the shadows like warts on a toad. I… cannot wear any of these clothes anyways. They are for women who matter and have worth. Worth far more than my own…
   Persephone is back, alone without Rem of the store owner. That is quite strange. I would have for sure seen them pass by me…Was I too distracted by the clothes?
   Persephone goes straight to Taryn and seems to confront her. After exchanging words, Taryn drops her act and notes she is a agent of the gods. She is investigating those interested in the relics, which is why she was after us. Just as I notice the guards entering the establishment, Taryn casts a spell. Ria, unsurprisingly is not caught off guard and attempts to use her own magic to prevent the spell. It was unfortunate that she failed and Taryn vanished. Persephone returns the dress gifted to her by Taryn which it really was taken from Giddeon. He offers us a discount for helping.
   After procuring some 10 foot poles, we are headed to the sewers. I am told to keep this in my front to warn us of impending enemies, as they are hard to see. Molly, acting as our key, lets us into the sewers
   I take this moment to ask the others about the enemies we expect to meet, such as why the poles and why the monsters are used for cleaning. Ria, the well learned intelligent woman that she is, explains these are gelatinous cubes and they melts things down with acid. That was all I need to hear and look towards Wuffi and lay my hand on his shoulder. Focusing on our bond and the blood withing my veins I adjust his nature. The scales on his body, the deep blue of the holy lightning begin to darken and change. Turning black from the contact with my hand and spreading throughout his body. The small sparks the emenate from the sides of his maw vanish, replaced with small drops of acid of his own. A small amount lands on the back of my hand as I move away. Usually, it stings quite a bit when I am careless like this. But this time… this time it was… muted. As if it did not hurt as much… 
   Not long in, my wooden pole finds purchase and we find our first cube. They are quite slow, and we are able to move away as it falls into the grates of a drain. Pressing out we find some other creatures, more solid than the cube and ready for a fight. As we begin to take them down more goo like creatures come from around the corner. I feel like this journey under the city will be quite lively. Maybe some time in the dark will be good for figuring out this more clouded path.

## Notes
- I asked if Lewis's mother survived, she died of starvation. This was when he was a younger man. Town he was from = **Vineroff**, southern town. He thinks he's weak, after the power with the artifact. Wants guidance, a god can give him answers and power. I told him he was selling himself short, has an inferiority complex, compared him to a highly eligible bachelor, told him to talk to the others before he made a decision. He handed me my new finished face plate and we thanked each other for our kindness.
- Lady Sabine Clawthorne = the Mayor
	- Has an eyepatch on her right eye, black hair in a bun, hot. Has a fully armored guard in one corner.
	- Asked how we were recommended by Captain Schwarz, Ria explained us rescuing Connor and the other soldiers from the imperials. Introduced herself as Lady Drakesbane, said she's here to take stock of the rebels and see if their cause are worth supporting. Concerned if history would repeat itself (the Rexum being a former rebellion leader too).
		- Sabine asked what she can do to get Ria on her side. Ria asked about Agnes Belkner, Sabine explained the machines are keeping their war effort going. Agnes is eccentric and has become extremely rich, egotistical. 
		- Sabine could arrange for us to meet at a council meeting, we could arrive as guests, but needs to also evaluate Ria of her worth. Asked us to assist in a matter.
			- One option - underbelly, a lot of sewer workers reported odd noises, gone missing. Find the source of the chaos and deal with it. Personal favor.
			- Other option - go after the adult black dragon nearby. Prestige.
	- We decided to go for the sewers first, after our business we may swing after the Dragon later.
		- They employ gelatinous cubes in the sewers. She gave us the general area to start looking in. Molly will join us to let us in, she is the key, skeleton key capabilities. They recommend 10 ft poles. She gave us a map of the sewers. Mechanicals don't function well in the sewers, corrosion. Give Molly a piece of paper to have her under our control.
	- I mentioned introducing her to Taryn, she said my dress looks similar to a dress to the most popular tailor in Maghaven. Gideon Montigue. Lady Sabine is currently wearing his work. I said I would do some investigating and get back to her on the nature of the dress. Stolen? Copied?
- We returned to the pub
	- Lewis, Valindra and I joined Taryn, I mentioned we showed off her work. She feigned knowing who the mayor was. She said her designs were originals, Taryn said she was a special savant. She seems like she is trying to play us, feigning cluelessness and innocence that her works resemble Gideon. 
	- I took Lewis to Valindra and my room, we failed an investigation check. Lewis told me she was lying, I figured I would continue to bluff with her.
	- META: Downstairs Taryn talked with Valindra, asked why she doesn't dress up as much, asked why Valindra still hid what's around her neck again. She cast suggestion on Valindra to suggest she wear it on the outside (dc 16). Valindra failed it.
- We visited Gideon Montigue, he had met Lady Taryn yesterday. This person seems under her finger. Charmed. I pulled Gideon aside. 
	- Lewis and Taryn talked. She took his measurements, asked if he and I were suspicious of her.
	- I took Rem and Gideon to the back office, said I was interested in commissioning something for Rem. I cast dispel magic on Gideon, dispelled a level 5.
	- Gideon was confused, said he met Taryn in his dreams, appeared by his bedside. She said she had made the dress, was going to be given to someone she knew. I asked Gideon what he wanted to do, arrest her. Rem and him went to fetch the guard out of an exit.
	- Taryn knew her control was broken, told me to stop lying, we had a frank talk. She said she could offer me more power, said she didn't want to speak around these mortals. Said she was here on the personal behalf of a god to investigate certain mortals. Probably Etifa. She winked and used Teleport to get out.
		- I gave the dress back, it was worth 200g. Gideon said he'd give us a 10% discount in the future.
- Sewers
	- Molly let us in, waiting for us at the entrance. Lewis cast Warding Bond on Rem. Valindra changed Wuffi to an Acid type, green now.
	- Avoided a gelatinous cube, fought some otyughs and a black pudding. Lewis cast spirit guardians.
