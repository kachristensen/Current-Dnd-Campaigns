## Summary
The party

## IC Synopsis - Dan
> Ria had cleaned the stink of the sewers from the party  before reporting back to Mayor Sabine. She praised our efforts, handed us a chest of gems and gold, and spoke of a meeting where we might face Agnes Welker—Ria to be invited as some guest of honor. Cults were mentioned, though Sabine couscous at first, hardly seemed concerned with an attack. She offered us a guest room, as we were seeking different logging, under Molly’s sharp eye, warning us not to wander.
   I gathered what I needed to finish Rem’s armor, bringing it at last to full plate. The others spent heavily on new Items for their magic—good investments if you ask me, though my own shaky faith demands I seek something more. St. Imelda’s name weighed heavily on me. I confessed to Rem the doubts I’ve carried and spoke of my family’s devotion. He listened, and we agreed he’d accompany me to the chapel in the morning.
   Valindra borrowed Rem for a little riding lesson for her and Wuffi. She has been antsy all afternoon if I do say so myself. As the two of them were leaving she asked me if I could improve her spear with the dragon scale.
   Meanwhile(Unknown to me) Perse tried to make peace with Ria, pressing her to drink, to share, to trust. Ria admitted little save that her noble blood taught her to guard herself. Molly even joined in, bringing wine and talk of mysteries. It seems everyone but me is trying to draw Ria out of her shell.
   At dawn, Rem and I found Father Erasmus. I prayed to Imelda and saw her likeness weep—pleading, sorrowful.I proclaimed my devolution right then and there.  Erasmus spoke of a ruined temple north of here, once hers, and he also placed in my hands a blessed amulet. I fell to my knees with gratitude. Rem’s prayers were darker—visions of plague, of Karz, of pain. He left unsettled.
   Later came Captain Gerard, a proud noble, armor shining brighter than his usefulness. He spoke of wyvern-riders and Vera Fontaine, asking for wine before giving anything of worth. We had little patience for him.
   Then the gathering. Nobles, rebels, even Chancellor Modron. Sabine gave us a private box. I wove a blessing of clarity over Ria and myself, while Rem sensed only the artifact Agnes carried. Ria approached her directly, and I kept back as her bladedoll blocked the rest of us. Agnes dripped with superiority, questioning Ria’s nobility, boasting of her “muse,” pretending it a mere replica. She insulted my craft without hesitation. (Inner thoughts) I only hope St. Imalda blesses me after I kill Agnes; she adds no appeal to craftsmanship. Agnes is revealing herself as a  sharp mind, selfish of heart, and blind to her own hypocrisy. She decries nobility, yet clings to her prize like any lord to his crown.

## Notes
- We returned to Mayor Sabine, told her of the cult and showed her what we recovered, were careful not to tell her too much about the cult. We also told her about Red and Taryn. 
	- She told us there is a council meeting in a day or two. Agnes will be there, Mayor Sabine will hire us to pose as security. Asked that Ria attend as a special guest to the council. 
		- I suggested we attend as Ria's security so we can attend the council meeting too. 
		- She's not expecting any threats, probably some squabbling. Concerned about cult activity. 
	- She's paying for our room and board, gave us 400g, 2 500g diamonds, 3 100g rubies
	- Ria asked about safer quarters, Mayor offered use of the guest wing. Her guardian is alive. Molly will be here to keep watch of things.
	- Rem asked about contacts for the dragon, she referred to us to Gerard, local town captain?
- Magic items
	- Blood well vial - 400g, Rhythm-Maker's Drums - 400g: 2-3 days to arrive
		- We spent 800g
	- Amulet of the Devout - Lewis has to go somewhere divine to obtain it
- Lewis crafted Rem the rest of his plate armor
	- Talked about Lewis's indecision. Lewis asked what Rem would do if his god wasn't talking to him and someone offered him power beyond belief. Rem asked what drew him to St. Imelda. It's who Lewis grew up knowing, who his family believed in, peacemaker. They stayed out of the war until his dad and bro were killed, him and his mom ran. Lewis is trying to find a peaceful solution but the LG is offering him it, has more impact/results than St. Im. Rem asked if he doubted his faith when they died, Lewis did, his faith persevered. Lewis was teased at the temple, given lower duties, but still believed. 
		- Rem asked what has changed--he doubts bc he can't reach her? Lewis feels like he isn't strong enough. Says we're on the frontline and make more impact, even Ria who stands back and commands the battlefield. We're powerful and make it look easy. Rem told him he's still contributing. Lewis feels like his power won't scale as fast as our challenges will, he won't be able to save everyone, wants to make sure everyone stays together. Rem said conviction is facing his doubts and trying to do his best. 
		- Lewis asked for Rem to come visit a temple with him. Maybe they can contact St. Imelda. Said it's hard not to see results and have LG's hand offered to him. Rem said he wouldn't judge Lewis if he decided to serve the LG, but he can't do so himself, would conflict with oaths he's already sworn.
		- Lewis said he's talked to Perse too about it, I'm of the same mind as Rem. Lewis said if 2 of his friends are saying the same thing, maybe we're right and he's overthinking. Rem would prefer if we didn't use it since binding our souls is poopoo, but Lewis is his own person, wiser than he is. Do as he sees fit if he wishes to better the world. 
		- Rem agreed to visit the temple and thanked him for his new armor.
- Perse apologized to Ria about being cruel earlier, offered to be get to know her better, Ria was suspicious, Perse tried to assure her, Ria agreed to talk to get to know each other but told me not to make her regret it. She trusts no one.
	- I took her indoors for a drink, asked her what she did for fun. She doesn't have fun, doesn't relax. She'd read, games, stories. Didn't enjoy music. I suggest she find a library or something, take an hour to relax. I asked what happened to her that made her so untrusting. She grew up among nobility. Doesn't trust them. Worried about betrayal. Those who she felt save with are either dead or well out of contact. She made friends in the military. She likes mysteries. 
		- Molly came by, offered some mystery literature, gave us special wine, was asked to make us as comfortable as possible.
- META: Rem taught Valindra how to ride Wuffi. Valindra thanked him. Shared a moment. Told her Valindra's stalking of Ria isn't common, Ria is shaken by it. Valindra said she talked to Perse, who told her the error of her ways, Valindra said she never meant to hurt Ria but understand. Said she couldn't get close without risking everything. Rem asked if L SJ speaks to her, she said no, just the once. She said there were 3 vials of L Sj's blood, she took one, 2 left. Valindra asked what questions she should ask--why she seeks to bring L SJ's back anyways. She said to end the time of strife, to keep them safe. He said to question if it's true. Better than the Rexum? Told Vali to think about what's best for her and Wuffi. Last time she thought of herself, she ran away. Told her it's ok to enjoy herself from time to time. Said Perse and him give good advice.
- Morning
	- Rem and Lewis went to a monastery. META: Lewis asked to have some time to pray/connect. They don't have a statue to St. I but keeps a portrait of her. Priest = Erasmus. 
		- Rem went to pray at each of the 10 main statues of the Divine. Rem overcome by a cough at Karz's, brief. Thought about Sally and his family. Erasmus talked to him, 10 years since Karz's death, asked if he was a follower. Rem said he's a Cathar, oaths are to the Grand Divine but the 10 serve it. Rem asked if Erasmus thought the GD put the 10 here to watch over the world, he agreed. Talked about peace and prosperity. Erasm said doubt is the enemy. If he wishes to hear the gods he has to be open to hearing them.
		- Lewis prayed to St I, said he walked without knowing the path, fear that his strength falters, lend him her light to guide his steps so that he doesn't walk in darkness. Flickering flame but he doesn't see or feel anything in particular come through. Eyes on the portrait turned sorrowful, pleading. He wishes to be hers and hers alone, a champion she can count on. Said he will cast aside all others.
			- Erasmus came in and talked with him for a while. Lewis asked him to keep the portrait for as long as he could and gave him 20g. Erasmus said he and his friends seem like they belong here, give the place a sense of renewal. E asked what they're in Maghaven for.
			- L asked if the priests had items, like amulets from their preferred gods. E said there is an abandoned temple to the north that used to revere St. I, may be beneficial to look at the ruins there. E brought out an Amulet of the Devout to give it to him, a gift.
	- They left the monastery, noticed this city isn't very religious. Lewis said he wondered why ppl gave up on religion, Rem chuckled and teased him, talked about how ppl's faith are shaken after the confrontation with the Rexum.
- Captain Gerard met us at Mayor Sabine's, fancy armor, Rem talked and asked for info, they know the location but soldiers were ambushed by the VS. Decided to hold off for now. looking for volunteers for expedition. Potentially. Said Vera Fontaine came by and will be around too. He'll give us the exact location if we give him a fine wine. He's looking for the funds to purchase his own. We declined, Perse whispered to Rem we already had a map. 
- Day after
	- Council meeting.
		- Sabine told us Agnes, all the major families. Also, Chancellor Ansa Modron, political figure of the rebellion will be taking the stage
		- Ria joined as herself, we r her entourage. Lewis cast Enhance Ability on himself and Ria, Wis and Cha.
		- Agnes on the other side of the balcony floor.
		- Proceedings - Next steps in the war, fate of Berdea which is currently split between beast folk, Dominion, and formally the rebellion. Cut losses and move on? Reorganizing to attack Laval, northern part of the continent.
		- Recess
			- Rem used Divine sense. Agnes wears something on her right arm that shines in his senses. 
			- Ria spoke to Agnes, said she wanted to meet her. Agnes let her approach, blade doll blocked the rest of us. 
				- Ria talked about the blade dolls, Agnes said there is a price attached to them. In some ways she likes the wealth, but used to be inferior, now she's superior, enjoying the role switch. Ria alluded to where the rebellion would be without her. Trying to access her character. Said she seems more significant than the others.
					- Seems like we can play to her ego. She's ambitious.
				- Ria asked what she thinks of the rebellion, she said she happened to be from Maghaven and made the most of it.
			- Agnes asked what Ria wants of her. Ria said we're looking for items, said we've been to one of the shops. Seen the bracers on the poster, asked about it. Agnes said it's her muse, replica of a very powerful artifact that was given to her. She said doesn't wear it on her person, but is lying. 
			- I tried to persuade her to give us the bracer to do better with it. She refused, said we're obsolete.
			- Valindra suggested we challenge her for them. I suggested we fight her blade dolls to prove we're more worthy of it. She asked what she gets out of it, maybe she would involve us in her goals. We suggested we could help her, bring reagents, Lewis could assist with crafting. Agnes said metal could craft better than him. 
			- Agnes seems not good. Believer in meritocracy. Doesn't like nobility. Probably not going to gamble it away, not willing to potentially gain another artifact in exchange.
