## IC Synopsis - Ria

## Notes
- We returned to Mayor Sabine, told her of the cult and showed her what we recovered, were careful not to tell her too much about the cult. We also told her about Red and Taryn. 
	- She told us there is a council meeting in a day or two. Agnes will be there, Mayor Sabine will hire us to pose as security. Asked that Ria attend as a special guest to the council. 
		- I suggested we attend as Ria's security so we can attend the council meeting too. 
		- She's not expecting any threats, probably some squabbling. Concerned about cult activity. 
	- She's paying for our room and board, gave us 400g, 2 500g diamonds, 3 100g rubies
	- Ria asked about safer quarters, Mayor offered use of the guest wing. Her guardian is alive. Molly will be here to keep watch of things.
	- Rem asked about contacts for the dragon, she referred to us to Gerard, local town captain?
- Magic items
	- Blood well vial - 400g, Rhythm-Maker's Drums - 400g: 2-3 days to arrive
		- We spent 800g
	- Amulet of the Devout - Lewis has to go somewhere divine to obtain it
- Lewis crafted Rem the rest of his plate armor
	- Talked about Lewis's indecision. Lewis asked what Rem would do if his god wasn't talking to him and someone offered him power beyond belief. Rem asked what drew him to St. Imelda. It's who Lewis grew up knowing, who his family believed in, peacemaker. They stayed out of the war until his dad and bro were killed, him and his mom ran. Lewis is trying to find a peaceful solution but the LG is offering him it, has more impact/results than St. Im. Rem asked if he doubted his faith when they died, Lewis did, his faith persevered. Lewis was teased at the temple, given lower duties, but still believed. 
		- Rem asked what has changed--he doubts bc he can't reach her? Lewis feels like he isn't strong enough. Says we're on the frontline and make more impact, even Ria who stands back and commands the battlefield. We're powerful and make it look easy. Rem told him he's still contributing. Lewis feels like his power won't scale as fast as our challenges will, he won't be able to save everyone, wants to make sure everyone stays together. Rem said conviction is facing his doubts and trying to do his best. 
		- Lewis asked for Rem to come visit a temple with him. Maybe they can contact St. Imelda. Said it's hard not to see results and have LG's hand offered to him. Rem said he wouldn't judge Lewis if he decided to serve the LG, but he can't do so himself, would conflict with oaths he's already sworn.
		- Lewis said he's talked to Perse too about it, I'm of the same mind as Rem. Lewis said if 2 of his friends are saying the same thing, maybe we're right and he's overthinking. Rem would prefer if we didn't use it since binding our souls is poopoo, but Lewis is his own person, wiser than he is. Do as he sees fit if he wishes to better the world. 
		- Rem agreed to visit the temple and thanked him for his new armor.
- Perse apologized to Ria about being cruel earlier, offered to help,
