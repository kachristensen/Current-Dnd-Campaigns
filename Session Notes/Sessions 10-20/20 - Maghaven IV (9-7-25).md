## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Ria
> 

## Notes
- We returned to Mayor Sabine, told her of the cult and showed her what we recovered, were careful not to tell her too much about the cult. We also told her about Red and Taryn. 
	- She told us there is a council meeting in a day or two. Agnes will be there, Mayor Sabine will hire us to pose as security. Asked that Ria attend as a special guest to the council. 
		- I suggested we attend as Ria's security so we can attend the council meeting too. 
		- She's not expecting any threats, probably some squabbling. Concerned about cult activity. 
	- She's paying for our room and board, gave us 400g, 2 500g diamonds, 3 100g rubies
	- Ria asked about safer quarters, Mayor offered use of the guest wing. Her guardian is alive. Molly will be here to keep watch of things.
	- Rem asked about contacts for the dragon, she referred to us to Gerard, local town captain?
- Magic items
	- Blood well vial - 400g, Rhythm-Maker's Drums - 400g: 2-3 days to arrive
		- We spent 800g
	- Amulet of the Devout - Lewis has to go somewhere divine to obtain it
- Lewis crafted Rem the rest of his plate armor
	- Talked about Lewis's indecision. Lewis asked what Rem would do if his god wasn't talking to him and someone offered him power beyond belief. Rem asked what drew him to St. Imelda. It's who Lewis grew up knowing, who his family believed in, peacemaker. They stayed out of the war until his dad and bro were killed, him and his mom ran. Lewis is trying to find a peaceful solution but the LG is offering him it, has more impact/results than St. Im.
