## IC Synopsis - Ria

## Notes
- We returned to Mayor Sabine, told her of the cult and showed her what we recovered, were careful not to tell her too much about the cult. We also told her about Red and Taryn. 
	- She told us there is a council meeting in a day or two. Agnes will be there, Mayor Sabine will hire us to pose as security. Asked that Ria attend as a special guest to the council.
