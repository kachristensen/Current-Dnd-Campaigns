## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Ria
> 

## Notes
- We returned to Mayor Sabine, told her of the cult and showed her what we recovered, were careful not to tell her too much about the cult. We also told her about Red and Taryn. 
	- She told us there is a council meeting in a day or two. Agnes will be there, Mayor Sabine will hire us to pose as security. Asked that Ria attend as a special guest to the council. 
		- I suggested we attend as Ria's security so we can attend the council meeting too. 
		- She's not expecting any threats, probably some squabbling. Concerned about cult activity. 
	- She's paying for our room and board, gave us 400g, 2 500g diamonds, 3 100g rubies
	- Ria asked about safer quarters, Mayor offered use of the guest wing. Her guardian is alive. Molly will be here to keep watch of things.
	- Rem asked about contacts for the dragon, she referred to us to Gerard, local town captain?
- Magic items
	- Blood well vial - 400g, Rhythm-Maker's Drums - 400g: 2-3 days to arrive
		- We spent 800g
	- Amulet of the Devout - Lewis has to go somewhere divine to obtain it
- Lewis crafted Rem the rest of his plate armor
	- Talked about Lewis's indecision. Lewis asked what Rem would do if his god wasn't talking to him and someone offered him power beyond belief. Rem asked what drew him to St. Imelda. It's who Lewis grew up knowing, who his family believed in, peacemaker. They stayed out of the war until his dad and bro were killed, him and his mom ran. Lewis is trying to find a peaceful solution but the LG is offering him it, has more impact/results than St. Im. Rem asked if he doubted his faith when they died, Lewis did, his faith persevered. Lewis was teased at the temple, given lower duties, but still believed. 
		- Rem asked what has changed--he doubts bc he can't reach her? Lewis feels like he isn't strong enough. Says we're on the frontline and make more impact, even Ria who stands back and commands the battlefield. We're powerful and make it look easy. Rem told him he's still contributing. Lewis feels like his power won't scale as fast as our challenges will, he won't be able to save everyone, wants to make sure everyone stays together. Rem said conviction is facing his doubts and trying to do his best. 
		- Lewis asked for Rem to come visit a temple with him. Maybe they can contact St. Imelda. Said it's hard not to see results and have LG's hand offered to him. Rem said he wouldn't judge Lewis if he decided to serve the LG, but he can't do so himself, would conflict with oaths he's already sworn.
		- Lewis said he's talked to Perse too about it, I'm of the same mind as Rem. Lewis said if 2 of his friends are saying the same thing, maybe we're right and he's overthinking. Rem would prefer if we didn't use it since binding our souls is poopoo, but Lewis is his own person, wiser than he is. Do as he sees fit if he wishes to better the world. 
		- Rem agreed to visit the temple and thanked him for his new armor.
- Perse apologized to Ria about being cruel earlier, offered to be get to know her better, Ria was suspicious, Perse tried to assure her, Ria agreed to talk to get to know each other but told me not to make her regret it. She trusts no one.
	- I took her indoors for a drink, asked her what she did for fun. She doesn't have fun, doesn't relax. She'd read, games, stories. Didn't enjoy music. I suggest she find a library or something, take an hour to relax. I asked what happened to her that made her so untrusting. She grew up among nobility. Doesn't trust them. Worried about betrayal. Those who she felt save with are either dead or well out of contact. She made friends in the military. She likes mysteries. 
		- Molly came by, offered some mystery literature, gave us special wine, was asked to make us as comfortable as possible.
- META: Rem taught Valindra how to ride Wuffi. Valindra thanked him. Shared a moment. Told her Valindra's stalking of Ria isn't common, Ria is shaken by it. Valindra said she talked to Perse, who told her the error of her ways, Valindra said she never meant to hurt Ria but understand. Said she couldn't get close without risking everything. Rem asked if L SJ speaks to her, she said no, just the once. She said there were 3 vials of L Sj's blood, she took one, 2 left. Valindra asked what questions she should ask--why she seeks to bring L SJ's back anyways. She said to end the time of strife, to keep them safe. He said to question if it's true. Better than the Rexum? Told Vali to think about what's best for her and Wuffi. Last time she thought of herself, she ran away. Told her it's ok to enjoy herself from time to time. Said Perse and him give good advice.
- Morning
	- Rem and Lewis went to a monastery. META: Lewis asked to have some time to pray/connect. They don't have a statue to St. I but keeps a portrait of her. Priest = Erasmus. 
		- Rem went to pray at each of the 10 main statues of the Divine. Rem overcome by a cough at Karz's, brief. Thought about Sally and his family. Erasmus talked to him, 10 years since Karz's death, asked if he was a follower. Rem said he's a Cathar, oaths are to the Grand Divine but the 10 serve it. Rem asked if Erasmus thought the GD put the 10 here to watch over the world, he agreed. Talked about peace and prosperity. Erasm said doubt is the enemy. If he wishes to hear the gods he has to be open to hearing them.
		- Lewis prayed to St I, said he walked without knowing the path, fear that his strength falters, lend him her light to guide his steps so that he doesn't walk in darkness. Flickering flame but he doesn't see or feel anything in particular come through. Eyes on the portrait turned sorrowful, pleading. He wishes to be hers and hers alone, a champion she can count on. Said he will cast aside all others.
			- Erasmus came in and talked with him for a while. Lewis asked him to keep the portrait for as long as he could and gave him 20g. Erasmus said he and his friends seem like they belong here, give the place a sense of renewal. E asked what they're in Maghaven for.
			- L asked if the priests had items, like amulets from their preferred gods. E said there is an abandoned temple to the north that used to revere St. I, may be beneficial to look at the ruins there. E brought out an Amulet of the Devout to give it to him, a gift.
	- They left the monastery, noticed this city isn't very religious. Lewis said he wondered why ppl gave up on religion, Rem chuckled and teased him, talked about how ppl's faith are shaken after the confrontation with the Rexum.
- Captain Gerard met us at Mayor Sabine's, fancy armor, Rem talked and asked for info, they know the location but soldiers were ambushed by the VS. Decided to hold off for now. looking for volunteers for expedition. Potentially. Said Vera Fontaine came by and will be around too. He'll give us the exact location if we give him a fine wine. He's looking for the funds to purchase his own. 
- Day after
	- Council meeting
