![[13 Jonas's Lab.jpg|center]]

## Summary
The party discovered Jonas's experiments negating the Secomortis plague with the use of lycanthropy and demon blood. Freeing his imprisoned demonic summon, Porto, the party then slew one of Jonas's patients transformed into a werewolf. At Jonas's behest they tracked down the remaining three and rendered them unconscious. Rem provoked Jonas into transforming into a massive demonic creature.

## IC Synopsis - Valindra

>I am not so sure how to react with this Jonas person. He has deliberately sat next to me and is talking to me! Being ignored or ridiculed is so much easier, but to actually talk to someone is different. I guess I have been getting better at it with the others being so open to talking with me, and treating me like a person.
  I must be careful like Persephone told me. He is asking for our help, and wants me to be the one to commit us to helping him. I do not feel like it is best for me to make such decisions, so I think it is best if Rem or Perse do, they are much better at understanding people. 
  Jonas told us that he was originally run out of town, but the citizens concerned with his work. He must review his lab first but will be needing us to help him. Perse told him to take the day and find us after. We arrived at Linna village a short time later. Jonas left to find his lab and the captain brought us to an Inn. Rem got us some rooms and food, while we waited for the captain to return with our reward.
  A whole bag of gold. More gold than I have ever experienced in my life! What do I even do with this? Am I even allowed to keep it? Perhaps I should give it to Persephone, it feels better than I having such a large sum.
  The boys went to bed early, I sometimes forget how tiring it must be to be human. Persephone suggested the rest of us visit the town. To my relief Ria decided to join us. I am glad she can stay close. 
  Lenna is such a cute village. Bigger than most of the places I have been allowed to go. We scoped out the local shops and blacksmith at Lewis’ request. It was nice to be able to walk the streets with my friends instead of Wuffi and I being relegated to the stables or some non-civilized location. The next morning, with the boys rested we spent a bit of our gold, equipping Lewis with some much better armor. Which is great with his need to be up close and getting beaten. That is my job Lewis, I am expendable. You are not.
  After shopping we realized we have not heard from Jonas yet. Being concerned I suggested we go find him. It did not take us long to find the burned remains of his lab. Leaving Anicca outside we explore the ruins and find a trap door to a basement. The fire left this area untouched; inside we found lots of science type stuff. As well as cages that had been ripped open and a creature left in another. 
  This was a demon that Persephone found quite interesting. Honestly her interest in it seem far too much. We learned his name to be Porto, and after some discussion agreed to free him for information. Lewis and Rem were quite on edge. They seemed ready to dispatch this creature at a moment’s notice. They even seem annoyed at Persephone for her interest in Porto too.
  He revealed that he was summoned to help Jonas finish his cure. That Porto provided knowledge to Jonas to create his more recent concoction. Being summoned by Jonas, Porto was agreeable to finding him for us. Which ended up being an unneeded assistant, as soon as we surfaced, Anicca was being attacked by a wolfman. Lycanprothy was known to me, but I have never seen such a thing before. This person was… feral. Much like man of the creatures of the forest. It looked human enough, but covered in fur, and altered bone structure. Without much thought we dispatched it quickly to save Anicca. 
  Jonas came running at us just as we slew this person. He ignored us entirely just to find the man dead and scolded us for killing an innocent man. If Jonas was here earlier, he would have seen how guilty this man really was. It was also evident that this man was stricken with sacromortis, though looking relatively well. 
  Jonas then tells us there are three others like this and where they might be. They are the patients he is treating with his cure, and tells us to subdue them rather than kill them. As we approach their location, Jonas stays far back, warning that the stress of this encounter is making him unwell. After subduing the other three as asked, Rem confronts Jonas.
  Rem seems quite upset at him. Both accusing Jonas of spreading the Lycan disease as well as colluding with Demons. Under Rem’s magic Jonas admits that turning these men into werewolves was his cure. But it was not a complete cure. It took the help of demonic blood for him to allow himself to remain sound. Rem seemed even more upset at this, and shoved Jonas back. 
  The stress seems to have been to much for Jonas. He body shifted and changed, growing to enormous proportions. His eyes seemed devoid of thought. He means to harm us, whether he wants to or not just like the werewolf patients of his. It is a little disheartening that he was so nice to me just to turn out like this. Kill or be killed is always how it is, and I will make sure we will survive this. I… I… seem to feel a little less certain than normal when grabbing my staff. Killing is easy, why do I feel like this time it is a little harder?

## Notes
- Jonas's continued conversation with Valindra
	- Lena village is where he initially set up shop, he had a lab, will probably need some aid recovering some assets
	- He was trying to get Valindra to make a decision on our behalf to help, assumed we did it to her. He assumed we told her what to do. 
	- He was ran out of town due to having the plague and experimenting with it. He needs more subjects to try his cure. He had some willing subjects initially. but it led to a lot of pain, results inconclusive--strong enough to negate secomortis. 
	- I said we would discuss it later, we'd be around Lena village at least enough to rest for a bit and he can propose payment when he knows more what the task will require
- Lena village
	- Schwarz led us to The Rusty Nail inn, keeper is Willy
		- Rem paid for us, 3g for rooms
		- Schwarz gave us 200g, said they were doing PR for Jonas
	- West side of town was under siege a few years ago, hasn't recovered since
	- Girls went out while the boys rested, we explored town, we're in a rundown area, but there's a more classy area to the south, east residential, market in the center
		- Outside of town there's a camp area for those with the plague
		- West part abandoned/ruined
		- Temple with pantheon + St. Imelda - Karz
- Next day
	- We bought Lewis plate and 1 revivify
	- Jonas's house
		- footprints, fresh blood, broken up and destroyed, once set on fire
		- busted trapdoor like something emerged from within
		- fiendish crow--doesn't look familiar with me but the rune are abyssal, meant to contain. Spoke to us somehow telepathically? Asked for its freedom from the cage and spell trapping it
		- Experimentation room, Rem also sensed a fiendish vibe from black liquid - Test Serum F. Last person to take it was Jonas himself.
		- Something from a cage burst out and ate some food, destroyed stuff. 2 dead bodies, old and rotted. One near an incinerator.
	- Crow - named Porto. He was summoned here to provide information. I suggested we join forces, wanted to be friends. He's a demon.
		- Rem wants to smite him.
		- Porto is here to find strong individuals. He was summoned to consultation to celestial plague, his blood is used to counteract. Experiments went bad, upstairs destroyed, prisoner escaped.
		- Jonas was his captor, another prisoner. The one in the cage fled a few days ago, but they've been down here for months, starving. Jonas came briefly. Porto said he could leave it to us. I asked if it was any demon blood that could help, or just his.
			- Porto has a grudge against Jonas for summoning him and holding him here.
		- Lewis said he'd let him come if I took responsibility for him. If Porto did anything, Lewis would annihilate him.
		- Porto said he won't bind himself to me, he's betrothed to another. But agreed to accompany us to see Jonas through. I plucked a feather from Porto and kissed it. I dispelled the circle and 
- Annica was being attacked by a werewolf outside. Hairless, secomortis plague. Jonas was running towards us, waving an arm and yelling at us to stop. 
	- Porto said there were at least 3 more werewolves. I told Jonas to focus on dealing with them first. Porto followed close behind me. 
- Jonas said he shouldn't come with us, due to stress of transformation. Lycanthropy, very hard to cure. His patients knew. They were triggered by hunger. Jonas is asking us to render them unconscious. They have killed already. 
- We found the 3 werewolves and I + Ria cc'd them all, we knocked them all out unconscious. They reverted back to human state, they're marked/scarred with the plague.
- Rem Zone of Truth
	- Jonas's experiments -- only these 3 survivors. All were initially willing. 
	- Jonas infected himself with demon blood, I haven't heard of this before. 
		- The lycanthropy is different.
	- He made a deal for knowledge and Porto was sent to him. He asked for a cure, once a cure was found he was to seek out the one he made a deal with--he only knows they're in the great chasm north of here, Verlatenland, contact them through his old tomes.
	- Porto was sent to recruit more. 
	- Rem shoved Jonas and baited him into transformed into a massive demonic form, something new I haven't seen before.
		- He's immune to charms and frightens
