## Notes
- After the fight
	- Rem let the Secomortis plague victims out, despite them saying they were sick and not to approach.
		- They think it's their only chance at survival. He told them it wasn't, to die with a purpose and take up a blade. Rita left to find Sally. The other two didn't. 
	- I asked about Althea, one of them spoke up, she was imprisoned with her but was moved to the temple a few days ago.
	- We went back to the temple grounds, one of the secomortis plague victims still there called out and alerted them, I shot him through the throat. 
	- The beastmen called out, offered a parley to meet with their leader. His follower swore on his god that they will be nonviolent. He said enter and go to the basement. 
		- Gregor. The other beastment don't have names.
		- We lied and sent them north to look for more recruits.
		- Bulky guard at the door is a beastman, trying to wear armor, a statue.
- Temple
	- No one in the main room.Statues of the 10 gods all smashed, older set of the gods, not the newer ones. 
	- Upper floor - it's been ransacked and looted, Ria and I looked through the papers. Found a journal, civil war for the last 10 years, Barca stayed neutral with the Rexum/the rebels in the south, which meant no one came to their aid vs the beastmen. 
		- Lewis and Rem found 2 vials of holy water, Rem mentioned to Lewis I was fiendish, Lewis said he'd save my soul if he needed it
	- Chanting coming down from the basement. 
		- Living God. Massive, gigantic figure, very long neck, multiple masked face (3-4). Beastmen/fanatics sitting there. A weeping woman with the early stages of the plague, starting to transform into a beastman. Echoing voice, called us his guests. In our mind. 
			- Said he's seen Rem in his dreams, he's been the voice that's communicating to him. Rem embodies his tenants, mercy and peace, so the Living God wished to speak with him. We have group telepathy.
				- META: Rem is replying  in Celestial.
			- He seeks to bring peace but needs those to help him. Eternal bliss to end misery and pain. Rem said better to die free than live a slave. Living god said free will/willpower is it's own form of slavery. He said it was of their free will, Rem asked about those in cages. Living god says warfare is required and lesser/mortal tactics to accomplish his goals. 
			- I questioned him, said there was pleasure in pain and misery, he doesn't know such things. I asked him if he knows mortal sadness and experiences, marriage and birth of children, etc, he said he did. Living god asked us to all gather around.
				- Valindra and I inspected the 3 sarcophagi, I got her to start opening them during  their conversation. holding a javelin, lots of symbols in it, lightning. 
					- 200 gold. 2 sapphires (500g ea)
				- Armor, half plate, glowing, possibly necromantic. 
					- 1 sapphire, pearl necklace of 50g
				- Fist-sized pearl
					- 20 gold, 1 sapphire
	- Living God is here to overthrow the Grand Divine. The gods are not true gods. The Grand Divine is an alien/not inherent to the world. The Living God used to be one of the gods before it. Great war between their siblings, only 2 survived, the Living God and someone else? The Grand Divine came from somewhere else and attached itself to this world. The Living God wishes to reconnect all the planes back together, to bring back the natural order as it should be back (including fiends!!).
			- Metaphor - cosmos is a book, the Grand Divine tore out a page. It's unnatural. 10 years ago, when Karz died, the GD's power weakened, allowing the LG to come back.
			- I asked about his other sibling, he dares not to speak his name, it's within the world slumbering under the surface. It's not the Devourer. The GD's presence does keep other entities at bay.
				- Religion checks - we know about a cult called The Hive Eternal worshipping the Apex Queen. Her real name isn't really mentioned since some kind of connection gets established if so.
					- META: Rem and Lewis know, Xi'Talla, mother of plagues. When a person plunges further into her madness, they become chitinous.
				- Goal of the cult is to awaken her, the Broodmother, she will extinguish all life and rebuild from the ground off.
			- Rem talked back to him, said it's not free will if we have to do what they say.
	- He said the Rexum is the "god's" pawn in their scheme, asked why we serve him. GD wants to hold on to what it has, never letting it go. 
	- I asked timeline, GD arrived 5,000 years ago. I spoke of the Abyss, it's a spilling of ink that has affected all pages. He said we would keep our free will if we want it, agrees we would be more helpful. As long as we're out of the way and wont hinder him, he'll give us the locket. If we agree to help, he'll give us something else.
		- Rem was against it. Valindra asked what if we lied. He said that he's peaceful but his beastmen aren't and will come after us. Rem asked what if we want no gods, for the people to rule. LG says we're incapable. People are prone to warfare and violence. 
	- He took off one of his hands and offered it to us, holding an amulet. The hand is the other extra gift. Said all will be revealed with the truth, we may change our minds. 
		- An oath sworn upon the hand of the Living God 
			- Curse: An oath sworn upon this item by a creature attuning to it will bind the artifact to them. This item cannot be removed forcibly, and will kill the wearer instantly if they intentioanlly take it off. The soul of the creature is immediately imprisioned inside the artifact from which only its creator can release.
	- GD is chained but LG doesn't have forever to stay here. The essence of these artifacts are required to kill gods, anything that has the essence of an outer plane.
			- Rem and I would need a boost to be eligible via an item
		- Rem said he wouldn't swear anything, if LG was truly a representative of peace 
	- I asked about my son and husband. They are both dead. Xchimaltia, goddess of death has their souls. I expressed my gratitude for him, said I would work with him. Asked if I serve him well, to reunite my souls with the others. He agreed.
- Rita and Sally had returned. 
	- Rem and Lewis talked to them. Sally doesn't want to become one of them. She came with us. Rita is convulsing in silence.
- We returned to the house.
	- LG's hand turned into a piece of golden jewelry. Requires attunement over a short rest. I didn't attune to it but learned about it. 
	- Loot - 
		- Half Plate of the Dead
			- While wearing this armor, you can use it to cast either Speak with Dead or Animate Dead. Once the armor has cast a spell in this way, it can't cast either spell until the next dawn. Your soul keeps this armor together. If you die while you are attuned to the armor, the armor is destroyed.  The wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
	- Javelin of Lightning
	- Pearl of Power
	- ![[Pasted image 20250601215646.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250601220852.png]]
	- Pearl went to Ria, I gave the hand to Lewis, Valindra got the Javelin, Rem got the half plate and the heart.
- Rem went to talk with Sally outside, tender moment. Said he truly doesn't think there's a good option. Spoke of his family and village, and the treatment. Said there wasn't any good options. Spoke of killing her.
	- Sally asked what if his mother was right. Asked what he would do. Rem said he would choose to die. She said freedom to be herself. Not feel trapped anymore. But she's not ready yet. He said that she risked being trapped in her own body. 
	- I stepped out and told him I can do it painlessly. Rem hugged her and let it happen. I summoned an illusion of Rita who came back cured, told her it was going to be alright and the beastmen had told the truth, wrapped her in a hug with Rem, tilted her chin up, kissed her, poisonous taste. We euthanized Sally.
- Lewis's msg to Theron
	- Theron we have been meeting stiff resistance at Barca there is no easy way into the city. is there any word on other lost items?
- Level up to lvl 5
