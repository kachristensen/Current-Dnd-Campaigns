## Notes
- After the fight
	- Rem let the Secomortis plague victims out, despite them saying they were sick and not to approach.
		- They think it's their only chance at survival. He told them it wasn't, to die with a purpose and take up a blade. Rita left to find Sally. The other two didn't. 
	- I asked about Althea, one of them spoke up, she was imprisoned with her but was moved to the temple a few days ago.
	- We went back to the temple grounds, one of the secomortis plague victims still there called out and alerted them, I shot him through the throat. 
	- The beastmen called out, offered a parley to meet with their leader. His follower swore on his god that they will be nonviolent. He said enter and go to the basement. 
		- Gregor. The other beastment don't have names.
		- We lied and sent them north to look for more recruits.
		- Bulky guard at the door is a beastman, trying to wear armor, a statue.
- Temple
	- No one in the main room.Statues of the 10 gods all smashed, older set of the gods, not the newer ones. 
	- Upper floor - it's been ransacked and looted, Ria and I looked through the papers. Found a journal, civil war for the last 10 years, Barca stayed neutral with the Rexum/the rebels in the south, which meant no one came to their aid vs the beastmen. 
		- Lewis and Rem found 2 vials of holy water, Rem mentioned to Lewis I was fiendish, Lewis said he'd save my soul if he needed it
	- Chanting coming down from the basement. 
		- Living God. Massive, gigantic figure, very long neck, multiple masked face (3-4). Beastmen/fanatics sitting there. A weeping woman with the early stages of the plague, starting to transform into a beastman. Echoing voice, called us his guests. In our mind. 
			- Said he's seen Rem in his dreams, he's been the voice that's communicating to him. Rem embodies his tenants, mercy and peace, so the Living God wished to speak with him. We have group telepathy.
				- META: Rem is replying  in Celestial.
			- He seeks to bring peace but needs those to help him. Eternal bliss to end misery and pain. Rem said better to die free than live a slave. Living god said free will/willpower is it's own form of slavery.
