## Notes
- After the fight
	- Rem let the Secomortis plague victims out, despite them saying they were sick and not to approach.
		- They think it's their only chance at survival. He told them it wasn't, to die with a purpose and take up a blade. Rita left to find Sally. The other two didn't. 
	- I asked about Althea, one of them spoke up, she was imprisoned with her but was moved to the temple a few days ago.
	- We went back to the temple grounds, one of the secomortis plague victims still there called out and alerted them, I shot him through the throat. 
	- The beastmen called out, offered a parley to meet with their leader. His follower swore on his god that they will be nonviolent. He said enter and go to the basement. 
		- Gregor. The other beastment don't have names.
		- We lied and sent them north to look for more recruits.
		- Bulky guard at the door is a beastman, trying to wear armor, a statue.
- Temple
	- No one in the main room.Statues of the 10 gods all smashed, older set of the gods, not the newer ones. 
	- Upper floor - it's been ransacked and looted, Ria and I looked through the papers. Found a journal, civil war for the last 10 years, Barca stayed neutral with the Rexum/the rebels in the south, which meant no one came to their aid vs the beastmen. 
		- Lewis and Rem found 2 vials of holy water, Rem mentioned to Lewis I was fiendish, Lewis said he'd save my soul if he needed it
	- Chanting coming down from the basement. 
		- Living God. Massive, gigantic figure, very long neck, multiple masked face (3-4). Beastmen/fanatics sitting there. A weeping woman with the early stages of the plague, starting to transform into a beastman. Echoing voice, called us his guests. In our mind. 
			- Said he's seen Rem in his dreams, he's been the voice that's communicating to him. Rem embodies his tenants, mercy and peace, so the Living God wished to speak with him. We have group telepathy.
				- META: Rem is replying  in Celestial.
			- He seeks to bring peace but needs those to help him. Eternal bliss to end misery and pain. Rem said better to die free than live a slave. Living god said free will/willpower is it's own form of slavery. He said it was of their free will, Rem asked about those in cages. Living god says warfare is required and lesser/mortal tactics to accomplish his goals. 
			- I questioned him, said there was pleasure in pain and misery, he doesn't know such things. I asked him if he knows mortal sadness and experiences, marriage and birth of children, etc, he said he did. Living god asked us to all gather around.
				- Valindra and I inspected the 3 sarcophagi, I got her to start opening them during  their conversation. holding a javelin, lots of symbols in it, lightning. 
					- 200 gold. 2 sapphires (500g ea)
				- Armor, half plate, glowing, possibly necromantic. 
					- 1 sapphire, pearl necklace of 50g
				- Fist-sized pearl
					- 20 gold, 1 sapphire
	- Living God is here to overthrow the Grand Divine. The gods are not true gods. The Grand Divine is an alien/not inherent to the world. The Living God used to be one of the gods before it. Great war between their siblings, only 2 survived, the Living God and someone else? The Grand Divine came from somewhere else and attached itself to this world. The Living God wishes to reconnect all the planes back together, to bring back the natural order as it should be back (including fiends!!).
			- Metaphor - cosmos is a book, the Grand Divine tore out a page. It's unnatural. 10 years ago, when Karz died, the GD's power weakened, allowing the LG to come back.
			- I asked about his other sibling, he dares not to speak his name, it's within the world slumbering under the surface. It's not the Devourer. The GD's presence does keep other entities at bay.
				- Religion checks - we know about a cult called The Hive Eternal worshipping the Apex Queen. Her real name isn't really mentioned since some kind of connection gets established if so.
					- META: Rem and Lewis know, Xi'Talla, mother of plagues. When a person plunges further into her madness, they become chitinous.
				- Goal of the cult is to awaken her, the Broodmother, she will extinguish all life and rebuild from the ground off.
			- Rem talked back to him, said it's not free will if we have to do what they say.
	- He said the Rexum is the "god's" pawn in their scheme, asked why we serve him. GD wants to hold on to what it has, never letting it go. 
	- I asked timeline, GD arrived 5,000 years ago. I spoke of the Abyss, it's a spilling of ink that has affected all pages.

- TODO: Ask Chris about the bodies on the sarcophagus, anyone
