## Notes
- After the fight
	- Rem let the Secomortis plague victims out, despite them saying they were sick and not to approach.
		- They think it's their only chance at survival. He told them it wasn't, to die with a purpose and take up a blade. Rita left to find Sally. The other two didn't. 
	- I asked about Althea, one of them spoke up, she was imprisoned with her but was moved to the temple a few days ago.
	- We went back to the temple grounds, one of the secomortis plague victims still there called out and alerted them, I shot him through the throat. 
	- The beastmen called out, offered a parley to meet with their leader. His follower swore on his god that they will be nonviolent.
