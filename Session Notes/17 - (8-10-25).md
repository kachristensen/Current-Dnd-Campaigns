## Notes
- Overnight
	- Valindra left our room for a while, went to go visit Anicca and Wuffi in the stables, asked Wuffi why he was upset with her. He said he was jealous of her riding the wyvern. Said maybe he should get bigger.
	- META
		- Rem's dream - running on all 4s in a golden field, compulsion to run in a direction toward something. Ria saw him twitching in his sleep. 
		- Lewis's dream - Living God asked about his gift, asked what Lewis was worried about. Lewis has already given his soul to St. Imelda, doubts and fear that they will conflict. LG doesn't know who they are, asked how Lewis knows them. Lewis said they were part of his family before he was rushed out of town. LG said he put the restrictions on the item to ensure it wouldn't be abused.
