## Notes
- Overnight
	- Valindra left our room for a while, went to go visit Anicca and Wuffi in the stables, asked Wuffi why he was upset with her. He said he was jealous of her riding the wyvern. Said maybe he should get bigger.
		- Valindra and I bathed, I washed her hair.
	- META
		- Rem's dream - running on all 4s in a golden field, compulsion to run in a direction toward something. Ria saw him twitching in his sleep. 
		- Lewis's dream - Living God asked about his gift, asked what Lewis was worried about. Lewis has already given his soul to St. Imelda, doubts and fear that they will conflict. LG doesn't know who they are, asked how Lewis knows them. Lewis said they were part of his family before he was rushed out of town. LG said he put the restrictions on the item to ensure it wouldn't be abused. 
		- Ria going over Jonas's notes
- Taryn in the morning
	- She pulled out a dress, stayed up all night. Gifted it to me, wanted to be an introduction, green and black sequins, flowy, nonmagical. She has some magical talents, she's from the north, from Vienimas. Lands above the Norvegg River are  barbarish lands, nomadic, not part of the dominion. I bought her bfast, she refused payment.
	- She asked about Valindra, was intrigued, asked more about her, said she could make her a dress. Said jewelry would compliment her, asked about her hiding her necklace. Vali said it gets in the way when we fight, said she's from the woods, Aosmhor, she seemed interested. Taryn said the north isn't as bad as everyone thinks it is. Cold, but can be good for the skin. They don't have elven slaves in Nordfyr. There are elves in the north who are free. She doesn't notice the differences too much. 
	- Lewis and Rem joined us. Lewis examined the dress. She thought Lewis and I were married. Teased us about a special relationship. 
	- Taryn said she's good at gossip, will keep an ear out for us. Didn't eat much breakfast.
- Leaving the inn
	- I asked Rem to Divine Sense Taryn, she's mix of fiendish and celestial.
	- Ria history check - she knows elves in Nordfyr are paler/snow-like, resistant to subjugation. 
	- Lewis cast Identify on the dress, nothing magical, just well crafted. 
	- We talked about our plan to visit Agnes, Perse suggested to skip the mayor since we have no reason to visit.
- Agnes's magical shop
	- Perse asked if we could meet with Agnes and shop for some items.
