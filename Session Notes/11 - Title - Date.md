## Notes
- Connor 
	- Battle was 2 days ago, I told him we're adventurers looking for something in the area, mercenaries, not allied with anyone. 
	- He's part of the Liberation League fighting against the tyranny of the empire, small shock troop group.
	- He tried to get Valindra to carry his bag, Rem grabbed it and gave it back to him, we told him she was our equal.
- We headed southeast
