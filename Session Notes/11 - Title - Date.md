## Notes
- Connor 
	- Battle was 2 days ago, I told him we're adventurers looking for something in the area, mercenaries, not allied with anyone. 
	- He's part of the Liberation League fighting against the tyranny of the empire, small shock troop group.
	- He tried to get Valindra to carry his bag, Rem grabbed it and gave it back to him, we told him she was our equal.
	- 18-19.
- We headed southeast
	- A bird with antlers was watching us. Rhinos nearby. A giant featherless horse bird thingy. Talon Beast and Peryton. I directed Valindra how to butcher it and we carved up the carcass of the Talon Beast, carrying it over Annica.
	- Connor was hitting on Ria, asked if she was alright, asked if she could teach him magic. 
	- We wandered past the rhinos, came across cockatrices, can petrify.
- We found The Freedom Force Five
	- 8 + 1 connor = 9, they're the fifth group though.
	- One of them recognized Ria as a Drakesbane. Ria took off her glasses. The dude was mad she was a noble family tied to the Dominion. Ria said she was interested in some of the other nobles who had defected but she wasn't here on their behalf. 
		- The dude is part of the Bruder family, Captain Schwartz Bruder, one of the defected rebels
		- I asked how he recognized her as a Drakesbanes, noticeable features.
		- I asked Ria about her family, they are higher nobles, chose the winning side, known for winning prowess. 
- We had dinner round their campfire
	- I convinced them to let us keep our weapons
	- They asked if they could hire us to rescue their comrades at a Dominion encampment, we conversed
		- Rem said aligning ourselves with rebels will cause issues. Recommended we could ransom the prisoners. 
		- Ria said we could disguise ourselves as rebels.
			- She's the only Drakesbane currently in the military.
		- I sent Theron a message saying we might have to infiltrate the rebels and attack a Dominion encampment. He said it was allowed, but to try not to kill anyone.
	- Our plan is to ask the rebels for all their gold and ransom the prisoners, purchase them back.
		- If that fails, we'll sneak in and try to free them while causing as little as much damage
		- Rem asked for the 100g upfront.
		- If we bring back the survivors, he'll give us a writ notifying that we're a friend of the empire.
		- Rem said we were doing our best to stay neutral, we will try to free the captives. 
		- Connor is the nephew of Schwartz. I joked about having him marry Ria. Captain said he was useless, didn't care about him much.
		- Ria shook his hand. We'll take the 100g, go on our own, if we deliver the prisoners back we'll get a lute and the writ.
			- He gave us a map of the area.
- Dominium Encampment
	- Rem, Ria, and Lewis approached. Valindra and I hid in the bushes.
- META:
	- Guy in heavy metal armor, Lord Aaron Von Krieger, member of the cathars. Has like a bubble head with liquid in it to keep him moist, also inflicted with secomortis plague. Rem knows him.
		- Rem, Ria, and Lewis entered his tent. Rem told him he was trying to avoid cutting a bloody swathe across the area, trying to negotiate a release for the ransom. 
		- A couple of the prisoners are already dead, but 2 of them are still alive.
			- One of them is Doctor Jonas Heisner who has developed a cure for secomortis plague. Aaron can't let him go without more info. Not sure if he's telling the truth.
			- Rem offered to interrogate him with Zone of Truth.
