###### Day 11

![[1 Desert Temple.png|center]]

## Summary
The party met with The Freedom Force Five and Captain Schwarz Bruner. In exchange for a writ of passage through rebel territory, they agreed to try and rescue the other members being held as prisoners of war at a nearby Dominion encampment. Rem led negotiations with Lord Aaron von Krieger, a fellow Cathar, and learned of the prisoner Dr. Jonas Haizner's attempts to negate the secomortis plague.

## IC Synopsis - Rem's Recollection

>The young man we rescued was a rebel soldier by the name of Conner Bruder, who had survived a battle two days past.  He was wary of Ria and Perse after their shouting during the brief skirmish, but proved quite talkative once we got moving.  He called his group the Liberation League, and guessed the battle had gone poorly for them given he was left behind.  He only knew the general direction of their camp, but he agreed to join us and introduce us to his comrades.  He tried to make Valindra carry his bags and inadvertently reminded us that despite their differences, the rebels and the Dominion had much in common.  Perse and I made it clear that Valindra did not serve him, or us for that matter, and he meekly apologized for his mistake.
  Lewis helped me salvage the saddle from Conner’s horse for Anicca, and Valindra led us Southeast towards the rebel camp.  We arrived in a desert valley rife with cliffs and coniferous trees after a bit of travel, and spotted rhinos in the distance.  They seemed content to graze, but monstrous, bird-like creatures watched us from above with hungry eyes.  We pressed on and ignored the peryton for the moment, when another bird-like monster charged us from the cliff.  This one was a talon beast, and it was larger, flightless, and featherless compared to the peryton.  Valindra made the first move, marking the monster with a red, draconic eye as she charged it.  Perse placed it under an illusion, which caused the talon beast to focus its attention on her.  The peryton took the opportunity to harass Ria, and paid for the transgression with its life when she unleashed a lightning bolt on both monsters.  The remaining beast didn’t last much longer as Valindra felled it with a leaping flourish, leaving it headless.
  Perse informed us that these monstrous creatures were not natural, per se, but were common enough sights.  Valindra and Perse carved up the talon beast while I loaded the meat onto Anicca, hoping to win over Conner’s allies with a gift.  Conner himself used the moment to speak with Ria, impressed with her magic and seeking guidance.  Or so he said anyway, his interests seemed more in the woman herself than her magic from my vantage.  Fearing further encounters should we linger, I urged the group to carry on.  If Ria was disappointed that her conversation with Conner was curtailed, she didn’t care to say so. 
  A bit further on we encountered a group of cockatrice.  Territorial and frisky creatures known for their petrification, we opted to avoid them with Valindra’s magic.  A prudent choice that proved even more so, as we snuck past a giant scorpion and spider along the way.  As we slipped by, Conner informed us the camp was nearby.  He went ahead to introduce us, but even with his rescue and a supply of meat, his comrades were cautious.  His uncle, a man named Schwarz Bruder, seemed to lead the group and our interrogation.  Ria in particular drew his ire, given her family’s status within the Dominion, but she persuaded Schwarz to let us into camp for food and further conversation.  Perse also took the opportunity to pry some information from Ria, learning that the Drakesbanes owed much of their status to aligning themselves with the Rexum and were also known for their own military prowess.
  Schwarz and his comrades did little to make us welcome, but did prove eager to enlist us to their cause.  The Dominion camp nearby was holding some of their allies prisoner, and Schwarz asked for our aid in rescuing them.  He offered 100 gold upfront, along with another 200 and a writ of passage should we succeed.  Perse also negotiated for a lute after we deliberated internally.  We all seemed opposed to unnecessary bloodshed but open to helping the prisoners.  Ria mentioned disguises and subterfuge, but I pointed out my lack of subtlety and suggested we approach the Dominion openly.  I suspect we all have our misgivings with the Dominion, but openly betraying them would cause us further issues.  Perse snatched up Lewis’s sending stone and consulted with Theron, who approved of our apparent betrayal if necessary but requested that we minimize casualties.  Reasonable, I thought, but I doubt the Rexum would feel the same.  I also reminded them of our promise to return with his artifacts, or not at all.  I ruminated over other oaths and how best to navigate them, but that burden was mine alone.  Ria concluded our negotiations with Schwarz, who voiced his displeasure at our aversion to violence and attempts at neutrality.
  Schwarz took Lewis and Valindra into his cabin to provide a map of the region, and I lingered nearby to ensure Valindra was treated reasonably.  I hardly wanted to kill the rebels, but their rude reception left me testy.  Fortunately, the transfer went relatively smoothly and we departed the camp promptly.  The trip to the Dominion camp took several hours but went without issue.  As we approached, Perse and Valindra split off and hid in the nearby brush while Lewis, Ria, and I approached openly.  I lit myself up and announced myself to the nearby watch, who went to retrieve his commander.
  A few minutes later, I was surprised to see my fellow Cathar, Lord Aaron von Krieger, led the camp.  Besides myself, he’s one of the few known survivors of the Secomortis plague.  While I rely on the sap for treatment, Lord Aaron wears a sealed suit of armor filled with a moisturizing agent to keep the plague at bay.  Lord Aaron was one of the Cathars sent to Shadeleaf back in my youth, and while our interactions were limited then I knew him to be honorable.  Retired too, I thought, but that had clearly changed.  He ushered the three of us into his private tent where I outlined our overall mission and requested his assistance.  He informed us that two of the four prisoners were already dead, but he’d entertain releasing one of the remaining two.  The fourth and final captive was a doctor by the name of Jonas Haizner, who claimed to have cured the plague.  Lord Aaron could not release him as a result, and I saw little point in arguing.  Instead, I asked to speak with the doctor myself, and Lord Aaron led us to the makeshift prison.  Lewis preferred to wait outside, mumbling something about the rings needing to be near each other. 
  Ria and I entered to find the two prisoners tied up.  I cast a spell to ensure honesty as we introduced ourselves and explained the situation.  Doctor Haizner was forthcoming about his research, and claimed that he countered the plague with a rival infection.  It did carry some risk and came with side effects: bloated joints, darkening of extremities, and at least one other convolution he refused to mention.  He was confident he could recreate his own successful treatment on others, but refused to work with the Dominion and hoped we would set him free.  I promised him nothing, knowing the Dominion, and Lord Aaron especially, coveted his knowledge.  I contemplated a compromise as we left the tent, and saw Lord Aaron standing with Lewis.  The bald man seemed uncomfortable and anxious, and for good reason I’d soon learn.  Lewis had divulged a great deal of information to Lord Aaron in our absence, including our possession of a divine artifact with our allies hidden nearby.  For all his wisdom, he doesn’t know when to shut his mouth.
