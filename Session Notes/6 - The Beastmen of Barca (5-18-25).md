## Summary
The party arrived at Barca. They met a girl named Sally inflicted with the secomortis plague, and fought off a large patrol of beastmen as they ventured in deeper. 

## IC Synopsis

>The women were awake when I roused; Perse whispering sweet somethings to Valindra.  My head throbbed from the ale so I administered the Rem-edy, as Ulrich and I would jokingly call it during our travels together.  This morning was no time for humor, however, and where the pain subsided the questions surfaced.  I wanted to write off my dream as a drunken hallucination, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was something more.  I put it from my mind for the moment, and donned my armor before we departed Hansel’s farm.  Given the tenseness of dinner the previous night, we slipped away without any further goodbyes.
  The sun was hardly up as Valindra expertly guided us through the brushland towards Barca.  I approached Lewis as we walked and asked about the sword I’d found in the dungeon.  He told me that it was superior to mine, so I unstrapped the old one and offered it to him.  There was no time for lessons though, and I had a more pressing topic in mind regardless.  I told him of my dream: of the endless golden field, the all-encompassing but nameless voice calling me “son”, the mention of misguided mercy, and being tasked to find them.  He did not balk at any of this or doubt me for a moment, to my great relief.  Lewis mentioned some of his fellows receiving visions or dreams of a similar nature, but if he’d experienced one himself he did not share.  When I pressed him on who he thought might have delivered such a dream, he agreed that Karz seemed most likely, even in death.  Another dead parent, I mused to myself, but at least for Karz it had been a swift death.  Now where does one find a dead god?
  Lewis pulled out the rusty glaive and continued working it back into a usable form as I thanked him for both the sword and his guidance.  Valindra took up my place shortly thereafter, at which point Lewis relinquished the repaired glaive into her custody.  After eight hours or so of travel, we arrived near the rocky outskirts of Barca and opted to make camp while we waited for nightfall to infiltrate the hostile city.  As we waited, Perse approached and asked me about my actions the previous night.  She did not seem angry so much as amused, and endeavored to learn what sort of interrogation techniques I could tolerate.  It was not something I had considered greatly beforehand, and found myself wondering at the answers internally.  She seemed dismissive of my moral quandaries and attributed them to youth, but so do I attribute her apathy to age.  Young I may be, but I’ve seen and even administered more than my share of mercy.  The plague is ruthless and cares not for age or attitude, but its cruelest aspect is that it leaves the reaping of the husks to those who survive.  Perhaps I should have said as much to Perse, but I struggled to find the words.  I did manage to tell her I was not upset with her, but at myself for not acting sooner or sober.  Her reaction to that was most strange: a request to observe the next outburst, and that I abstain from alcohol beforehand.  It was all I could do to agree, though I hardly plan for such events.
  As our conversation concluded, we saw a patrol of five beastfolk and an extremely pale man approaching.  He had red markings all over his bare torso and face, unlike anything I’d seen before.  Fortunately, we chose our vantage well and remained unseen.  As the sun set shortly afterwards, we made our way towards the outskirts of the broken city of Barca.  The architecture was once grand but now was burned and crumbling.  We found a small house in similar shape outside the city proper, inside of which Valindra, Perse, and Wuffi noticed an adolescent hiding.  I was volunteered to approach and parley, which ended up being a particularly wise decision.  I persuaded Sally to reveal herself, and immediately recognized the markings on her face and arms as the early stages of Secomortis.  Perse moved to offer the girl some food, but I barred her way for fear of it spreading to my companions.  I left all my rations with the ailing teen and learned that others, including her mother Rita, had been taken by the beastfolk to be cured.  They claimed they could cure any disease, and perhaps that is true, but I shudder to think of the cost.  Perse requested a private conversation among our group and I shared a bit of my experience with the plague.  She offered to kill the girl if need be, and I’d be lying if I said I had not considered it, but I wasn’t ready to go that far just yet.  Instead I explained to Sally the situation as gently as I could, and let her drink from my flask to delay the disease.  Without regular treatments it won’t amount to much, but neither could I sit idly by and do nothing.
  Sally had mentioned a hidden path into Barca and agreed to lead us there.  The confined quarters of Barca did little to aid our attempt at subtlety and we found ourselves between two groups of beastfolk shortly after entering the city.  We were outnumbered, but the alley was narrow and I shouted to hold the choke as we were engaged on two fronts.  The pale, red-striped human leading one of the groups demanded our surrender, but Perse used her enchanting magic to frighten him instead.  Lewis bolstered a few of us with a blessing, while Ria granted Wuffi the breath of a larger dragon with her own magic, and I allowed the divine fire within me to burn without once more.  I do not know if Valindra failed to hear me or understand my meaning, but instead of holding our position she rushed into the Southern group of enemies.  Wuffi paid for this with his life before both Lewis and Valindra found themselves surrounded.  Their leader shouted for them to take us alive, but we were not nearly so merciful.  Perse and I managed to hold the Northern end of the alley while Lewis was the next to fall in the Southern engagement.  Perse roused him with a healing word and he returned the gesture with some healing of his own.  Unfortunately for the bearded man, he’d fall twice more during the battle.  Perse saved him a second time in similar fashion, but Valindra and I also fell to our wounds as Lewis fell for the third time.  Ria shared her flask with Valindra, who in turn did the same for Lewis, or so they told me later.
  Most of our foes had been felled when I blacked out, and they were all dead when I woke up to Persephone feeding me her flask.  I am thankful that despite our differences we can count on each other when things are grim, but that sentiment remains unsaid for now.  Sally ushered us through a small opening she made in a nearby building as Lewis chanted a healing spell and Perse urged us to hide the bodies and signs of battle.  Whether or not we achieve this small reprieve remains to be seen.

## Notes
- Rem cured his hangover with lay on hands. I teased Valindra jokingly about her banging him last night while they were off alone.  
  - We traveled 8 hours to Barca, sandstone w/ broken Arabian architecture.   
- We waited for nightfall. I spoke to Rem during this, asked him why he killed the beastman. 
  - To put it out of his misery. He doesn’t want mutilation. Would be fine with capturing it without the torture. Was upset he didn’t stop it sooner and that he had to be drunk. Lewis can make chains and a muzzle.   
    - I told him to feel his rage and despair instead of drinking it away. I find it amusing and pleasurable.  
  - Rem talked to Lewis about the greatsword and his visions, Lewis has never had one. Rem had a dream last night. The entity seemed confused about his mercy but called him his son, told him to seek him out. Maybe Karz? Lewis mentioned maybe the god was attracted to his deeds.  
    - Lewis also repaired the dragon tooth glaive.   
- 1 hr later \- group of beastman and 1 human walked by. They sniffed the air. We managed to stealth. They passed by. Human guy was bald, shaven, extremely pale skin, red markings, looks like Kratos, shirtless, in sandals.  
- We snuck over to the city. Something small and scurrying in an abandoned house, went under the bed. Young small child, teens, trembling, afraid.  
  - Rem approached with a lantern, kid told him to go away. We persuaded her it was safe, young girl. She has secormortis. Sally. Her family was captured. She’s been sneaking out at night and finding food. Rem asked how long she’d been ill, told her she was sick. She didn’t know. She has about 4 months left, seems to have been seek for 2-3 months.   
    - Karz sap is a treatment, not a cure.  
    - I asked if there were others who were also sick, she mentioned a few older ones. Happened shortly after the dog people came.   
  - I asked her for some sneaking tips on the routes she’s discovered. She said the ppl have been taken to the center, where we’re going. Her mother Rita, looks like her, also has the plague, was taken a week ago.  
    - We group-huddled to discuss the plague. Shadeleaf was quarantined but occasionally the plague has struck elsewhere. It’s typically been centralized, usually not this far south.  
    - I asked what Rem wanted to do, he wanted to give her his flask.  
      - Said we should kill the other infected and quarantine them. He mentioned bringing Sally back to the capital, maybe they would treat her.   
    - Rem gave her all his rations. He told her about the plague. She was in denial. Asked if he would help. There is no cure but a treatment.  
      - The dog-men claim they have a cure for any illness. Rita said she wanted to investigate, so she left to look for it.   
      - He gave her his flask.   
  - We continued forward with Sally. She said the patrols go every hour, it’s been 30 minutes so far.  
    - We got caught by 2 patrols, fought them. Wuffi died. Very hairy fight.  
    - She kicked in the doors to find us a hiding spot, we started to prayer of healing/move the bodies/prestidigitate.
