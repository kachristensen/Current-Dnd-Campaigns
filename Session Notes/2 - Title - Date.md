## Notes
- Lewis sent Theron a message about the bear attack, we carried on. Frank’s tracks led in the wrong direction so we continued onwards without him. We made it to Ivarham and got a tavern. Valindra hesitated and I covered her ears and ushered her in. The Lucky Rabbit. Tavern keeper, old lady. Greta. Rem was charming to her, gave her an extra gold.  
- Valindra has never been propositioned for sex, she seemed unfamiliar when I invited them to spend the night in my room. I asked her about her age, mid 60s? She’s considered an adult. Whole party shared a room together. She recommended we head south through the forest so we did.  
- Forest is known to have some fey creatures in it. First day uneventful.  
- Watch order at night  
  - 2 hrs \- lewis vali  
  - 2 hrs \- vali ria  
    - META: they conversed, Valindra asked why Ria’s showing her eyes now, she responded that now we’re all on a long-term mission together, so it would’ve happened. Vali spotted scales on Ria’s neck last time. Vali asked why she covered it. Ria said the Dominion doesn’t swallow differences. Avoids unwanted attention. Valindra asked about pride in those differences, Ria said she didn’t have any. Pride is to be earned. Vali heard something circling around them, hasn’t shown itself yet. Echo-y voice, just watching. Mouth, feline eyes, cheshire-cat ish. Said it was enjoying our conversation. Vanished, creepy. Sylvan  
  - 2 hrs \- perse ria  
    - Ria prefers bronze, I pondered what jewelry would look nice on Valindra. The face appeared back, said we were boring.  
  - 2 hrs \- perse rem  
    - Rem drank from the flask, I asked him about it, it prevents the symptoms of the plague, which turns people into dried out husks.  
      - We talked about it, he’s from Shadeleaf, got it at 11, tree sap prevents the symptoms, he went a year without it, started drying up, shrivelling. I told him maybe we could find some magic to help. Said I was something in between mortal and immortal.  
      - Giant cat offered info on a cure for the flask, I gave him a mug with a sip of it, he asked if we’d heard of **Yaluska of the Mire**.  
        - Witch, known to exist even back in my day, in this forest, immortal. Older than the Nine current gods. Rumored to be powerful. Said she’s nearby where the ground turns wet and squishy.  
        - I told him we tired of him afterwards, shooed him away.  
      - We were ambushed by Yeth Hounds  
- Text RP  
  - Perse and Rem flirted, Rem said he hadn’t known a womans warmth, Perse questioned him about it, gently turned down his interest in her, further teasing/playful banter  
  - Perse reacted with shock at Valindra’s statement her true lord was Sajja’ka, the Bronze Terror. Lewis and her had a hissy fight over her reaction.  
    - Valindra grew up as part of the Order of the Veridian Scales, was regularly beaten and treated as an inferior. Leader Blackwood gathered everyone for an important meeting, but Valindra felt guidance from Lord Sajj’aka to leave and walk a different path. Wuffi appeared a week later. Was the first time she’d ever been alone.  
  - Rem has an uncle named Mirko who taught the drums, and is in Shadeleaf  
  - Frey’s parents made her learn the violin, strict?
