## Notes
- Lewis asked about the group, what we went through. Was experiencing second thoughts about how much killing we did.
	- Theron responded to Lewis - "Two. Indeed an item in valdrhiem, beyond our reach still. Other, rumored to be in Rebel hands."
	- Rebels are to the north coast, we could sail partially the way there. 
	- Lewis is a farm boy. Rem seemed dismissive, said we could just travel back around the coast, none of us know how to sail, we don't have a ship. Rem is being snippy and went off to bed.
	- Dagmar is birthplace of the Rexum. 
		- Rebels - bracer of Cirrepeti (they/them).
		- Valdrheim - Shield of Foshorey, goddess of protection and victory 
	- Lewis has chosen the Dominion, to search for peace/diplomacy. He kills in self-defense and prays for forgiveness. 
	- I asked Valindra about Sajjaka, if she wanted to talk to him, after she asked about Lewis's relationship with his god. Sajjaka sent Wuffi to Valindra. I asked if he was a spy, he said nah, first memory was Valindra.
		- I urged her to talk to Rem, since he hates Lewis and me, Ria isn't empathetic, and Valindra is cute and fluffy.
- Lewis went to go talk to Rem. Lewis apologized for making his day worse by being snippy. Rem apologized for being short with him.
- I asked Ria what her thoughts were about all this. She doesn't think the LG is great. I asked about what she wanted. She thinks I'm a spy for the Obscura. I told her i'm here for info, the group is more valuable to me now. Girl talk. She asked what I am. I asked her what she hides under her outfit. We agreed to a pact of secrecy. I said I was a half demon. META: she was fascinated. Ria's deformed and doesn't want anyone to see it.
	- I went to find some of Rem's alcohol, fished out his flask. I put it back. Rem woke up and grabbed my wrist. Was super pissed off.
- Ria and I kept watch. Someone was watching us, Ria didn't want to go investigate them, I checked them. Ashy pale skin, female priestess. 
	- She's here to keep an eye on us. I asked why she speaks so well, many don't choose to take the offer of enlightenment, they choose to serve still. They were freed from the servitude of tyrants. I asked where she was from. From lands beyond the unsailable sea. Zidara. I waved Ria over to talk.
		- She asked how Zidara got here. The Prophet/LG calmed the oceans to get them across. For a grander purpose. They believe in his purpose. She comes from the lands of the dragons, their slavemasters. 
		- I tried to wake Rem up, he told me to piss off. Ria tried to stop me.
		- There are still some dragons left, many have been killed.
			- Valindra asked why. They were enslaved, dragons were the oppressors. There are shadowfolk, the dragons keep them away by simply being. They come from the desert, malformed humans, long teeth/arms, 
		- Lewis asked why she was here. The prophet wishes to free people of this land as well from their oppressors too. 
		- Zidara asked what we were. I said we were all some variation of human except Valindra, who's an elf. Zidara didn't know what that was.
		- I asked why LG turns them into beast folk. Bc it's true enlightenment, to be present in only the moment, no thinking beyond that. I said we could experience more joy as we are, she doesn't know what we're talking about. 
		- I invited her to join us, she declined. Just supposed to keep watch and make sure we left their territory safely. 
		- Perse and I kept watch together. I'm 423 years old.
