## Notes
- Lewis asked about the group, what we went through. Was experiencing second thoughts about how much killing we did.
	- Theron responded to Lewis - "Two. Indeed an item in valdrhiem, beyond our reach still. Other, rumored to be in Rebel hands."
	- Rebels are to the north coast, we could sail partially the way there. 
	- Lewis is a farm boy. Rem seemed dismissive, said we could just travel back around the coast, none of us know how to sail, we don't have a ship. Rem is being snippy and went off to bed.
	- Dagmar is birthplace of the Rexum.
