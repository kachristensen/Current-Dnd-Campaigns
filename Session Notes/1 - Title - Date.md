## Notes
- Summoned to the capital of The Dominion, **Verdigheim**. Greeted by a short man in robes, mid 40s, **Theron Lodroth**, grand vizier who summoned us. We all had letters of recommendation. He cautioned us when approaching the Rexum, can be intense, be respectful and don’t challenge his ego.  
  - Large throne, large Rexum, 50s, weathered look.   
  - Recommendations  
  - **Ophani** Cassio Beckett Monsignor Ludvig Kiyavir, Exarch Sigrid Fremdell  
    - Mine \- Witched expert of eldritch arts, the Obscura endorse her to fit and adapt, illusions, enchantment, loyalty is to the work, understands the value of a secret kept,   
    - Rembrandt Eifert, of the Cathars, apprentice of a dude who fell to a plague,   
      - 6’3”, strapping young lad, wavy curling gold hair, molten gold eyes  
      - He divine sensed, Rem has a faintly celestial aura, Perse faintly fiendish. I commented on his eyes.  
    - Brother Lewis, cleric, healer  
    - Grand Magus Rollo Jesari, Lady Ria Drakesbane, mage corp, scholar, disciplined, arcane master lithe build, short pale blonde hair, early mid 20s, dark clothing covered. Dark lenses obscure her eyes.  
    - Valindra Tel Rena, lieutenant of reconnaissance, one of the Disavowed, treasonous associations, speed, useful but degenerate elf, 5’8”, auburn ponytail, deep red eyes. Wuffi is blue, her companion, seemed happy.  
  - Divine items were dispersed. Go behind enemy lines, be covert, return them. We’ll receive supplies and more info.  
  - The Rexum spoke to us, said we were all representing the Dominion, and thus him, doesn’t tolerate failure, return with them or don’t return at all, will cost us our lives.  
- Vizier’s office  
  - Jars of oddities on the walls. Wizard?  
  - Intel \- one of the items south. Rebellions, invaders, marauding beast folk,  
    - Etifa \- locket (godess of love). In Barca, south peninsula.  
    - Another item \- city of Valdrheim, ruins from the Rexum destroying it, ghost town, undeath, attack the living on sight, numbers growing. For now we’ll pursue the locket.    
    - 6th vizier \- he has learned from the mistakes of his predecessors.   
    - We can return with them all at once if we want, or one by one.  
    - He gave us one of a sending stone, Lewis took it.  
    - Showed us a flask of sap from the tree of Raz, has healing properties. Refills once per day. Vitality Flask.  
    - 3 day trip with cart to Iverheim, then 2 days on foot through forest, then 2 to Barca.   
    - Obscura contact \- **Alfira**, green eyes, missing left ear. Presumed dead, last heard in Barca.   
    - Heart of Etifa in the central administration building. Glass pendant, under the size of a fist, maelstrom of energy inside, magenta pink in hue. Warding against illusions and charms.  
    - Invaders led by The Living God. Ppl arriving/leaving continent is unprecedented.   
    - Valindra is familiar with the Aosmhor Forest, she’s from the area, doesn’t have family near where we’re going.   
    - Rembrandt got 15 gold for a barrel of ale,   
  - Verdigheim is a gothic city, Rexum hates nobles  
    - We went with Rembrandt to buy a barrel of ale to a tavern called the Golden Knot.   
    - Valindra isn’t allowed inside, so Lewis stayed outside with her. I asked her, she said she wasn’t allowed to due to her ears.  
    - Otis the innkeeper seems friendly with Rembrandt, I failed to persuade him for a deal. Otis checked in on Rembrandt to make sure he’s ok  
      - Rembrandt mentioned he’s been anointed, seems different since he drank from the tree sap?   
      - Otis gave him “Otis’ Spice”, special drink  
      - Three cheers for Rembrandt’s first crusade.  
    - I commented on Ria’s spectacles, she was mysterious about them.   
    - Lewis nerdgasmed about metal to Valindra. She instinctively acted like a servant.  
    - META: Valindra and Ria have some sort of preexisting acquaintanceship, caught up, seem to trust each other  
  - Wagon  
    - I braided Lewis’s beard, he let me  
    - Drivers \= Valentine, Frank  
    - Rembrandt’s been knighted, I asked – he used to be a sickly boy, they gave him the sap of the tree  
    - They asked about Melusinae, I explained corpse moths, she’s one of the last of her species, symbiotic relationship with her, she allows me to see, I mentioned it was difficult to see with age  
    - Lewis said he’s not much of a fighter, he’s a smith, loves metal, worships a god. Mended Valindra’s armor, she didn’t want him to waste magic on her. He swore he would protect us.  
    - Ria has slitted cat eyes, yellow. She has fangs. Dhampir? She wears the spectacles to hide them.  
    - I spoke Draconic to Wuffi, commented he was a lot smaller than she was used to. We all speak Draconic except Lewis.  
    - META:	 Rem was drinking from the flask each day  
  - 3 days later  
    - We heard a driver scream, wagon fell to its side. Giant bear attacking the horses.

- Lewis send Theron a message about the bear attack, we carried on. Frank’s tracks led in the wrong direction so we continued onwards without him. We made it to Ivarham and got a tavern. Valindra hesitated and I covered her ears and ushered her in. The Lucky Rabbit. Tavern keeper, old lady. Greta. Rem was charming to her, gave her an extra gold.  
- Valindra has never been propositioned for sex, she seemed unfamiliar when I invited them to spend the night in my room. I asked her about her age, mid 60s? She’s considered an adult. Whole party shared a room together. She recommended we head south through the forest so we did.  
- Forest is known to have some fey creatures in it. First day uneventful.  
- Watch order at night  
  - 2 hrs \- lewis vali  
  - 2 hrs \- vali ria  
    - META: they conversed, Valindra asked why Ria’s showing her eyes now, she responded that now we’re all on a long-term mission together, so it would’ve happened. Vali spotted scales on Ria’s neck last time. Vali asked why she covered it. Ria said the Dominion doesn’t swallow differences. Avoids unwanted attention. Valindra asked about pride in those differences, Ria said she didn’t have any. Pride is to be earned. Vali heard something circling around them, hasn’t shown itself yet. Echo-y voice, just watching. Mouth, feline eyes, cheshire-cat ish. Said it was enjoying our conversation. Vanished, creepy. Sylvan  
  - 2 hrs \- perse ria  
    - Ria prefers bronze, I pondered what jewelry would look nice on Valindra. The face appeared back, said we were boring.  
  - 2 hrs \- perse rem  
    - Rem drank from the flask, I asked him about it, it prevents the symptoms of the plague, which turns people into dried out husks.  
      - We talked about it, he’s from Shadeleaf, got it at 11, tree sap prevents the symptoms, he went a year without it, started drying up, shrivelling. I told him maybe we could find some magic to help. Said I was something in between mortal and immortal.  
      - Giant cat offered info on a cure for the flask, I gave him a mug with a sip of it, he asked if we’d heard of **Yaluska of the Mire**.  
        - Witch, known to exist even back in my day, in this forest, immortal. Older than the Nine current gods. Rumored to be powerful. Said she’s nearby where the ground turns wet and squishy.  
        - I told him we tired of him afterwards, shooed him away.  
      - We were ambushed by Yeth Hounds  
- Text RP  
  - Perse and Rem flirted, Rem said he hadn’t known a womans warmth, Perse questioned him about it, gently turned down his interest in her, further teasing/playful banter  
  - Perse reacted with shock at Valindra’s statement her true lord was Sajja’ka, the Bronze Terror. Lewis and her had a hissy fight over her reaction.  
    - Valindra grew up as part of the Order of the Veridian Scales, was regularly beaten and treated as an inferior. Leader Blackwood gathered everyone for an important meeting, but Valindra felt guidance from Lord Sajj’aka to leave and walk a different path. Wuffi appeared a week later. Was the first time she’d ever been alone.  
  - Rem has an uncle named Mirko who taught the drums, and is in Shadeleaf  
  - Frey’s parents made her learn the violin, strict?
