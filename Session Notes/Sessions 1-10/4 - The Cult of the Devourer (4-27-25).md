## IC Synopsis - Lewis

> I woke up to a beautiful sunrise. We started the walk early.  Pushing to the town we have over a day's journey to Barca. We trekked for almost 6 hours before coming to a small little farm. We started walking along a road that went in front of the farm.  However there was an interesting structure blocking the road right in front of the farm house. As we approached we heard a voice telling us to drop our weapons or face an ambush. Rem and Persephone are the first to comply.  I drop my weapons however I am hesitant to drop my shield and just take a few steps back getting ready to charge up a guiding bolt if necessary. Rem and Persephone talk us out of a situation I think we could have taken easily. I wouldn’t have felt right about killing a family.
   Hansel the Father of the household pleaded with us after he found out we were soldiers going to Barca. Hansel asked us to find the bandits that took his youngest daughter “Sarah” and son “Ben”.  They were taken only yesterday night as they bolted west.  Persephone then  started Recruiting the father to join us as a guild. Ria was full heartedly against bringing dead weight which I also agreed with.  We had the general direction and it didn’t sound like they would be much help. Alas Persephone Charms this kid “Luke” into joining us. A 20 year old boy with a spear that looks like it's been sitting outside being neglected. This upset me greatly so I snatched it from him and as we walked I removed the rust and tried to bring back the shine it once had.  Luke talks about a few caves being west of his family's farm.  While I wasn’t surprised by Valindra’s action thus far being quiet and toward the back of the group.  I guess hearing that children were taken lit a fire under her ass as she took point in the investigation for where these bandits went.  With ease and determination Valindra pinpointed the cave they went to.  Leaving Luke outside to watch the exit we push forward.
   "Dark" doesn’t even do a justice for how much I could see.  My hands had no outline when put in front of my face.  Thankfully Rem enhanced my hammer with light, finally able to see I wrapped my hammer with my blanket so we could remain hidden.The ladies take point for they have no problem seeing in the dark.  We walk through this dark corridor Rem leading me through and we are able to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  Hearing voices the ladies take action taking the… Cultists! The ladies take action slaughtering them where they stand, burning them, slicing them, hitting them with charms and vicious sorcery. We hold nothing back! Ria talks about the cult that we just slaughtered. “ The Hungering Path” is a cult of cannibals waiting to be eaten by their god.  How revolting.  The last door in this room we find one more cultist that disturbingly Persephone pleasures for information by eating one of his fingers.  After the information was given Persephone Kills the cultist and spits out his finger.  I am very relieved that she did not partake in their beliefs. A shrine was placed in the room which I took pleasure in destroying for you St. Imelda.  We found the kids after a little more searching. Ben had his leg taken from him and Rem heals him the best he can. Rem carries Ben back to the entrance as Sarah joins us in formation. We leave the two kids with Luke and Rem hands out a few more javelins as he tells them to go home and we will meet them there. After heading back to the cages we find a humanoid beast locked in a cage that Persephone finds interest in. I will be watching her closely for funny business.
   The darkness continues as we step into a new room right away the smell is so revolting i can barely keep my lunch down.  Valindra took a few more steps then abruptly vomited on the floor. If I new where she was I would have given her a towel to clean up with. No one tells me anything while we are sneaking around.  I would later see that Ria used a cloth and her magic to comfort Valindra. As Persephone and Ria coordinate  fliping switches, to then hear a few sounds unlocking and a slab closing and the others see a massive crab like beast in a pool filled with some type of liquid.  In and out of shadow we trace our footsteps back to the doorway they passed at the entrance. The door now open we enter to the sounds of eating and still a grotesque smell.  Looking into the room we can see a big ass “Bean” looming in the middle of the room. Stepping closer we hear the door slam behind us.  Perse takes no time at all to jump into combat, scaring the Devourer  into submission for most of the fight. Rem also surprised me by lighting himself up with celestial revelation shining with radiant power.  Ria with a new look of determination brings out “Super Sorcerer”mode.  Ria dropping big spells holding nothing back causing massive damage.  After we think the battle is won the head drops back while the stomach opens with a toothy maw.   The battle rages on, Valindra takes the most heat as she goes unconscious while grabbed by the tongue of the devourer.  Perse plays a tune to wake Valindra.  I heroically pull her free from the grapple.  As we exchange a few more blows I black out for only a second when I see a glowing angle above me (Rem).  Slowly coming to my feet I see Valindra Slice the devourer down in nothing less than a critically damaging blow as she finds the weak spot on its back.  The adrenaline still hitting everything slows. We won.

## Notes
- We long-rested then continued to Barca. Came across a hamlet.  
  - Guy told us to drop all our weapons, was very wary, we were evasive but evaluating the area on orders, Hansel. He said he had a problem with raiders. They abducted some of his children. Not beastfolk, they’ve been stealing crops and livestock, rooms were broken into. He thinks they’re from west of here. Only his son Luke left, young man, and his business partner Richard. Kids Ben and Sara taken. Persephone insisted Luke join them, Ria was resistant, but he came. Would show us the way and hide.  
    - Lewis grabbed Luke’s spear, was disappointed at its condition.  
  - Valindra seemed very distracted and wouldn’t pay attention to Persephone.   
- Valindra tracked the kids to a cave, Luke wouldn’t look at her, I threatened to bewitch him if he didn’t look at her, he looked in her direction but wouldn’t make eye contact. I linked elbows with Valindra in support.  
  - Campfire, hadn’t been used in longer than a week. Girls stealthed forwards, unstealthy boys in the back. We found an iron door. Runes on it, Arcana, some sort of meaning, reminds me back in my day. Cultish, demonic? Praise. I failed to pick the lock.  
  - Something moving in the room with light behind us. Yelling, laughing, carousing. Around a table, feasting. Talking about how great their food is. Referring to the “cattle” that they own, excited to try them. Cannibals?  
  - Symbol of a mouth, cult of the Hungering Path, worship a being known as the Devourer. Entity who will consume the world and purify it after digesting it. The cult purifies by eating anything and everything. Cannibals.  
    - We kept one alive, I persuaded him to tell us what he knows before he dies by telling him I’d eat him afterwards, he said to prove it, I bit off a finger and killed him after, slit his throat, flicked the finger away after. He mentioned their leader is past the locked door, should be a lever down in the prison to unlock it.  
  - We went down to the prison and found the kids. Ben and Sara. Ben had one leg severed. Rem healed him.   
    - We found a beastfolk person in another cell, chimp-human-beast thing. Nonresponsive, just panicked. More dead ones nearby.  
      - Seemed charmed. Has a goal to complete.  
    - We took the kids out to Luke, he said he’d take him back to the farm and be waiting for us. Ben \= 16, Sara \= 19\. Rem gave them each a javelin.  
    - We proceeded in, room full of dirty water, rank smell, crabs, Valindra puked. Faint light, chute of stuff falling down from it. Something in the water. Ria and I mage hand timed pulled two levers in sync, a giant grab appeared but didn’t see us.  
  - Big door unlocked  
    - We peeked in, slurpy eating noises, giant Bean thing. Massive grotesque obese person, gigantic, eating and tossing stuff down the hole. Mouth of the Devourer.  
    - Rem did celestial revelation, microwave mode. We defeated it.
