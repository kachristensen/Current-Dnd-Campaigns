![[6 Barca.jpg|center]]

## Summary
Over the course of their rest, the party discussed events together. Persephone was caught rummaging through Rem's things. Zidara, a servant of the living god, observed them and was questioned about her origins from across the sea. They received instructions from Tharon over the remaining artifacts to pursue and proceeded forward.

## IC Synopsis - Lewis

>Valindra and Perse start a conversation about how each of them are doing. I paid them little mind as I wanted to talk to Theron and at least tell him of some progress we made.  It’s been some time will he be mad? I should tell them the truth about everything we have done and seen. Lewis sends a message to Theron “We have been meeting stiff resistance at Barca there is no easy way into the city. Is there any word on other lost items?” I was quite surprised to get  a response. I was happy to hear him stating “Two, indeed.  An item in Valderheim, beyond our reach still. Others are rumored to be in Rebel hands.  Learning that the stone has multiple uses I asked more in hopes for an expansion on his  words as well as the upcoming decision on movement of our group. “What item is in the rebels encampment? What does it look like and what is it called?”  Theron replied with “Rummors named bracer of the god pain and torture (Cirrepeti), can’t confirm at the moment”  Proceeded with the question ”How about the one Valorhiem do we know what holds it? What does that item look like what is it called?  “Confirmation that it’s the Shield of Foshorey, Goddess of protection, justice, and victory”
  After the day we have had I let the group know about how I felt. The others didn’t really care as they felt justified that the beast men were just that beast men. We discussed possible routes to take. I mentioned that there is a place we can cross the sea, However the group is against that and out voted me to go back the way we came. We also planned to head north to get to the city Berdea to get information on the rebels and we learned that Dagmar was a part of a kingdom called Hochstadt. Even the Rexum hailed from Dagmar.
  Perse did also ask me about st’ Imelda and why I chose her as my Patron. The group wondered why I would side with the dominion however peace is not one sided.  Vialindra also talked about sajj’aka and spoke about her past.  After our discussion I pissed off Rem with some smart ass comments. After rem had left I felt bad because not only I had a hard day with hard choices. I went to the room before I took my watch and apologized. I believe he understood and went to bed.  During my watch I made platinum rings for a later date. I believe these will be able to save someone if used in the right way.  Nothing happened during my watch so I said good night to Ria and woke Perse for her watch. Then I went to bed.
  Being woken abruptly by Perse proclaiming that someone named Zindara is outside watching the house and we need to talk to her.  It appeared that Rem had moved during his slumber to the grave site of Sally.  As we spoke with Zindara it was most interesting how the LG had killed Dragons in their territory and now was here to “free us” with the full support of these followers as Zindara.  What honestly interested me more was the word of Shadowfolk and how they were malformed and attacked from the desert of this land beyond our own.  Maybe the LG is actually running from this threat, I keep those thoughts to myself.  After our conversation i go back inside back to sleep
  In the morning I had told Rem I would help him with his armor however when I got to him it was as it was perfectly made for him. I started to ramble “Yes—that’s the part that catches the eye, isn’t it? When you first see it, it looks rigid, sculpted, like ceremonial plate left in some forgotten tomb. But the moment it senses touch—your touch—it starts to move. Not like a machine, no gears or hinges. It bends and twists like heated silver, like iron taught to flow. You’ll see seams vanish, edges curl inward, joints tighten and wrap close around bone and muscle. Plates that looked sharp fold smooth, sweeping in elegant curves as it molds itself to your body like a second skin of forged moonlight. And it doesn't just fit—it knows where to hold you firm and where to yield. You can feel the metal shifting with each breath, each motion, subtle adjustments like it’s alive, reading every twitch of your nerves. It's not just armor anymore. It’s a conversation between will and metal.” Ideas I could never have seen in armor came to light. Before I completely went crazy over this unnatural armor we finished getting ready and headed north towards the forest.  As well I will note that Rem summoned a horse magically I didnt think that could happen. I can't wait to see the new tricks we all have Instore!

## Notes
- Lewis asked about the group, what we went through. Was experiencing second thoughts about how much killing we did.
	- Theron responded to Lewis - "Two. Indeed an item in valdrhiem, beyond our reach still. Other, rumored to be in Rebel hands."
	- Rebels are to the north coast, we could sail partially the way there. 
	- Lewis is a farm boy. Rem seemed dismissive, said we could just travel back around the coast, none of us know how to sail, we don't have a ship. Rem is being snippy and went off to bed.
	- Dagmar is birthplace of the Rexum. 
		- Rebels - bracer of Cirrepeti (they/them).
		- Valdrheim - Shield of Foshorey, goddess of protection and victory 
	- Lewis has chosen the Dominion, to search for peace/diplomacy. He kills in self-defense and prays for forgiveness. 
	- I asked Valindra about Sajjaka, if she wanted to talk to him, after she asked about Lewis's relationship with his god. Sajjaka sent Wuffi to Valindra. I asked if he was a spy, he said nah, first memory was Valindra.
		- I urged her to talk to Rem, since he hates Lewis and me, Ria isn't empathetic, and Valindra is cute and fluffy.
- Lewis went to go talk to Rem. Lewis apologized for making his day worse by being snippy. Rem apologized for being short with him.
- I asked Ria what her thoughts were about all this. She doesn't think the LG is great. I asked about what she wanted. She thinks I'm a spy for the Obscura. I told her i'm here for info, the group is more valuable to me now. Girl talk. She asked what I am. I asked her what she hides under her outfit. We agreed to a pact of secrecy. I said I was a half demon. META: she was fascinated. Ria's deformed and doesn't want anyone to see it.
	- I went to find some of Rem's alcohol, fished out his flask. I put it back. Rem woke up and grabbed my wrist. Was super pissed off.
- Ria and I kept watch. Someone was watching us, Ria didn't want to go investigate them, I checked them. Ashy pale skin, female priestess. 
	- She's here to keep an eye on us. I asked why she speaks so well, many don't choose to take the offer of enlightenment, they choose to serve still. They were freed from the servitude of tyrants. I asked where she was from. From lands beyond the unsailable sea. Zidara. I waved Ria over to talk.
		- She asked how Zidara got here. The Prophet/LG calmed the oceans to get them across. For a grander purpose. They believe in his purpose. She comes from the lands of the dragons, their slavemasters. 
		- I tried to wake Rem up, he told me to piss off. Ria tried to stop me.
		- There are still some dragons left, many have been killed.
			- Valindra asked why. They were enslaved, dragons were the oppressors. There are shadowfolk, the dragons keep them away by simply being. They come from the desert, malformed humans, long teeth/arms, 
		- Lewis asked why she was here. The prophet wishes to free people of this land as well from their oppressors too. 
		- Zidara asked what we were. I said we were all some variation of human except Valindra, who's an elf. Zidara didn't know what that was.
		- I asked why LG turns them into beast folk. Bc it's true enlightenment, to be present in only the moment, no thinking beyond that. I said we could experience more joy as we are, she doesn't know what we're talking about. 
		- I invited her to join us, she declined. Just supposed to keep watch and make sure we left their territory safely. 
		- Perse and I kept watch together. I'm 269 years old. I talked to her about elvenkind, she didn't know they lived that long. I talked to her about completing her goals, her thoughts on the dragons, etc.
	- META: Rem and Valindra talked, Rem was salty about me. Said I was a creature of impulse and immaturity, despite my age. Recommended that Valindra keep the heart.
		- Vali mentioned how cross everyone is, she wants to help. Rem said it's not her part to make up for Perse's mistakes. Says I can talk to him if I grow up, not Valindra's responsibility. Called me immature. 
		- His brothers were 7/8 years old. He drinks to handle it, asks himself what his mother would do. Tries to do what he thinks is right. Softer conversation, bonding, he said she was selfless and good, should forgive herself, and thanked her for calming him down.
		- Valindra attuned to the Heart of Etifa. Heart beat faster, almost like caffiene/anxiety. Persistent. Stronger emotions.
- Morning
	- Armor adjusted to Rem's body as he attuned to it
	- Rem cast Find Steed. Annica, unicorn, kitsugi/veins of molten gold, white. 
		- I said she was beautiful, Rem ignored me and gave me the cold shoulder.
	- We're still being followed by Zidara.



Rem is surly, snippy, lash out at everyone, petulant, tantrum, can't take a joke, get over yourself.
