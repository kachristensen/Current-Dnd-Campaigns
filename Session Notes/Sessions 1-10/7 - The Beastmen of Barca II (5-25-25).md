## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone

> **Pleasure, Peril, and Driving Beasts Feral**
	Sheltering nearby with Sally afright
	We soothed and persuaded her to take flight
	Lewis’s prayer of healing
	Left our loins erotically feeling
	Before we set the house alight
	\
	Rem spoke to Valindra most considerately and tactfully
	And urged her to heed and contribute to strategy 
	She revived Wuffi before we slipped away
	To find a safe haven to wait out the day
	And slunk northwest most deftly and agilely
	\
	Along the way we came across survivors encaged
	With guards and sentries and a colossus enraged
	Valindra and I
	Took position to spy
	Then snuck away and disengaged
	\
	On our way returning, we were waylaid
	By a group of beastmen who howled and bayed
	Before I could tease
	Valindra dropped to her knees
	And pleasured them until they sprayed
	\
	We continued unburdened back to our group
	To strategize and plot and rest and recoup
	Lewis upgraded his armor
	Fondling Rem the charmer
	Until his greatsword quivered and drooped
	\
	We returned to the prisoners on the next night 
	Pitting spell and blade against claw and bite
	With their numbers numerous
	And their members voluminous
	The beastmen came at the sight 

## Notes
- Prayer of Healing  
  - We sent Sally home, she said to continue to head northwest.  
  - Ria asked for alternate paths, she’s not sure how to explain.   
  - We gathered the bodies inside. Valindra revived Wuffi, it melded into her shadow, I asked her about necromancy – Wuffi is a spirit, she just resummoned him.   
  - Ria suggested we burn the place for cover, GFB  
  - Rem suggested Valindra follow a battle plan in the future, conversation about minimizing her taking dmg, but encouraged her to speak up and offer ideas  
- Travelling NW, successful stealth, made it to the temple  
  - Found lots of prisoners outside it in cages  
  - We retreated to a nearby house for cover  
    - Rem suggested Lewis craft better armor  
    - 1We talked about the prisoners, infected, freeing them? We talked about plans, going to keep watch the rest of the night, then rest during the day. The boys are staying to work on Lewis’s improvements. Wuffi is staying with them \+ Ria.   
  - Valindra and I headed over back to the prisoners to keep watch  
    - One cage of plague victims, possibly Sally’s mom there  
    - Althea, my obscura contact, is not there  
    - Prisoners sleeping, beastmen chilling, speaking in Draconic. More active watch closer to daytime  
    - One armored beastman dude near the entrance to the temple. Only one of his kind.  
      - Perimeter check around the temple closer to dawn. There are packs & groups all around the temple, HQ. Well guarded all around.   
      - We found a street walled off, MASSIVE giant feral beast thing there, seems wilder/more aggressive – they’re throwing food/scraps into its giant pen   
  - Day watch \- we saw big massive guy being walked around in chains, patrols. Ria suggested we could release it for havoc.  
    - I asked Lewis to make manacles/muzzle for a beastman prisoner. He was able to make manacles but can only do one at a time.  
- Next night \- prisoner fight
