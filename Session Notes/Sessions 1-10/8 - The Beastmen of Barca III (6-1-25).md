###### Day 8

![[6 Barca.jpg|center]]

## Summary
The party rescued the prisoners and spoke with the Living God on his motives, learning more about the outside influences gripping the world and tearing it from the rest of the planes, as well as his attempts to restore peace and the way things were before. They acquired both the locket of Etifa and the Hand of the Living God, choosing a neutral approach to his offer to join him for now. After Sally's mother chose to pursue the beastmen's transformation to survive the plague, the party returned back to her house and rested. Rem and Persephone comforted Sally and euthanized her.

## IC Synopsis - Valindra

>Why are they hitting me so much!? The whole first half of this fight the beastmen kept hitting Rem. I only killed a few of them, why do you turn their attention to me?! I should really have a conversation with Wuffi about dying so easy. It would be so much better if he was here right now!
  Though the battle was hard fought we won! Maybe there is something to listening to Rem about using this chokepoint…
  Finding keys on the human leaders, we were able to free the captured. Though the sickened did not wish us to do so. Rem took it upon himself to free them and find Sally’s mother. She is with the group and rushes home to Sally. I wonder if my mother would rush so quickly to me if she still lived.
  After the ministrations of Lewis and a brief rest, we advance to the temple again. The cultist that escaped had returned with what looks like reinforcements… Curse myself for not going after him. But I did not want Rem to be cross with me again. The priest spoke and bid us peace and to speak with their leader.  We all agreed it is likely a trap but best to follow the invitation. It can’t be a trap if we know it is one, right?
  After quickly clearing the upper floors and finding no residents we descended to the basement. Lewis and Rem found some holy water as we headed down. I take the lead as usual to keep the others safe. Making sure to keep Ria in the back away from any traps that might injure us. 
  As I turned the corner, what I suspect is their leader comes into view, a large, long necked being with multiple faces. It is quite unsettling. More so was it bid us to enter without sound reaching my ears. The first thing we see is a victim of the plague being turned into one of the beastmen. It was a lot to witness. The woman almost seemed happy to have this done to her.
  Rem stepped up to speak to this creature, while I noticed Persephone wander off. Which as Rem began to converse with this creature, I noticed Persephone bid me to her. I headed to her and found several stone graves. She asked me to open them, of which I followed her orders. Not too sure why she wanted them opened until finding treasures within.  There were riches for sure but the one thing that stood out to me was this javelin adorn with lightning bolts. This is perfect for Ria! She seems to be fond of the lightning spells. Of course there is no better element, as that was Lord Sajj’aka’s alignment. This will make a fantastic gift for her!
  As I took the lids off these coffins, Rem and the creature spoke. It was uncanny as I could hear this creature with no issues. Even with my ears, it should have been muffled, but clearly, I heard it. It spoke with Rem about the Grand Divine and itself. It being called the Living God by the beastmen. The Living God stated it was the Grand Divine’s sibling and that it fled this world eons ago. There being a third sibling as well, though it would not speak the name. 
  It was the Grand Divine that created the world as we know it, cutting it off from the other planes. As well as being the being trying to create order in the world. Sending agents to try and enact this order. Only sending in new agents when the previous ones failed…. Even the dragons failed in this god’s eyes? That is why it sent the accursed Giants? This thought sticks to my mind as it continues to talk of the world. How that the Prime Deities are just pieces of the Grand Divine. It was the death of the Deity Karz that allowed the Living God to slip back in to this world
  It is here that it tells us it has our objective, the Heart of Etifa. Willingly giving it to us but also offering another item, the Living God’s Hand. If we swear an oath to it, we can take this artifact. It will provide us the necessary “essence” to slay a god. Apparently, a piece of the outside plane is needed to slay these divine beings. The downside is, swearing this oath and using the artifact traps the user’s soul in it. 
  This “god” wishes to reunite the planes. Though itself is non-violent.  That is why it is acting through others. Which is that not the same as driving the blade into someone’s heart yourself? If you ask another to do it? It even mentioned why it changes those to beastmen. Saying that only will do so to the willing. And that it is giving them an ever-lasting bliss, at the cost of losing one’s own self and self-control. Honestly. I can think of no worse fate.
  Rem leaves in a huff, adamant to swear no oath to this god or as he seemed to put it, the hypocrisy. Ria followed after. I stayed to wait for everyone to leave, as Persephone stayed behind to speak with the “god.” Asking about some personal desires, and agreeing to the Living God’s bargain. For now, the beastmen will not harm us, as long as we do not to them first. 
  Outside we find Sally and her mother. Who was bringing Sally to be “cured.” Now being aware of this cure, we convince Sally that it is a fate worse than death, and she leaves her mother with us as we return to the house where we met Sally. Taking time, we decipher what the items were that we found. I was right! This javelin was imbued with lightning magic. I eagerly offer it to Ria. I could not wait to see her graciously accept it. Such an important person shouldn’t be without a weapon either, so it is just perfect…. She… Doesn’t want it? But… It fits so well… Oh I should have it? I mean, your reasoning makes sense… I just thought you would like a gift…
  As we figure out the rest, Rem goes to speak with Sally outside, Persephone following after. Poor Sally, her mother left her for this false cure. I do hope the two of them can find some kind words for the poor girl.

## Notes
- After the fight
	- Rem let the Secomortis plague victims out, despite them saying they were sick and not to approach.
		- They think it's their only chance at survival. He told them it wasn't, to die with a purpose and take up a blade. Rita left to find Sally. The other two didn't. 
	- I asked about Althea, one of them spoke up, she was imprisoned with her but was moved to the temple a few days ago.
	- We went back to the temple grounds, one of the secomortis plague victims still there called out and alerted them, I shot him through the throat. 
	- The beastmen called out, offered a parley to meet with their leader. His follower swore on his god that they will be nonviolent. He said enter and go to the basement. 
		- Gregor. The other beastment don't have names.
		- We lied and sent them north to look for more recruits.
		- Bulky guard at the door is a beastman, trying to wear armor, a statue.
- Temple
	- No one in the main room.Statues of the 10 gods all smashed, older set of the gods, not the newer ones. 
	- Upper floor - it's been ransacked and looted, Ria and I looked through the papers. Found a journal, civil war for the last 10 years, Barca stayed neutral with the Rexum/the rebels in the south, which meant no one came to their aid vs the beastmen. 
		- Lewis and Rem found 2 vials of holy water, Rem mentioned to Lewis I was fiendish, Lewis said he'd save my soul if he needed it
	- Chanting coming down from the basement. 
		- Living God. Massive, gigantic figure, very long neck, multiple masked face (3-4). Beastmen/fanatics sitting there. A weeping woman with the early stages of the plague, starting to transform into a beastman. Echoing voice, called us his guests. In our mind. 
			- Said he's seen Rem in his dreams, he's been the voice that's communicating to him. Rem embodies his tenants, mercy and peace, so the Living God wished to speak with him. We have group telepathy.
				- META: Rem is replying  in Celestial.
			- He seeks to bring peace but needs those to help him. Eternal bliss to end misery and pain. Rem said better to die free than live a slave. Living god said free will/willpower is it's own form of slavery. He said it was of their free will, Rem asked about those in cages. Living god says warfare is required and lesser/mortal tactics to accomplish his goals. 
			- I questioned him, said there was pleasure in pain and misery, he doesn't know such things. I asked him if he knows mortal sadness and experiences, marriage and birth of children, etc, he said he did. Living god asked us to all gather around.
				- Valindra and I inspected the 3 sarcophagi, I got her to start opening them during  their conversation. holding a javelin, lots of symbols in it, lightning. 
					- 200 gold. 2 sapphires (500g ea)
				- Armor, half plate, glowing, possibly necromantic. 
					- 1 sapphire, pearl necklace of 50g
				- Fist-sized pearl
					- 20 gold, 1 sapphire
	- Living God is here to overthrow the Grand Divine. The gods are not true gods. The Grand Divine is an alien/not inherent to the world. The Living God used to be one of the gods before it. Great war between their siblings, only 2 survived, the Living God and someone else? The Grand Divine came from somewhere else and attached itself to this world. The Living God wishes to reconnect all the planes back together, to bring back the natural order as it should be back (including fiends!!).
			- Metaphor - cosmos is a book, the Grand Divine tore out a page. It's unnatural. 10 years ago, when Karz died, the GD's power weakened, allowing the LG to come back.
			- I asked about his other sibling, he dares not to speak his name, it's within the world slumbering under the surface. It's not the Devourer. The GD's presence does keep other entities at bay.
				- Religion checks - we know about a cult called The Hive Eternal worshipping the Apex Queen. Her real name isn't really mentioned since some kind of connection gets established if so.
					- META: Rem and Lewis know, Xi'Talla, mother of plagues. When a person plunges further into her madness, they become chitinous.
				- Goal of the cult is to awaken her, the Broodmother, she will extinguish all life and rebuild from the ground off.
			- Rem talked back to him, said it's not free will if we have to do what they say.
	- He said the Rexum is the "god's" pawn in their scheme, asked why we serve him. GD wants to hold on to what it has, never letting it go. 
	- I asked timeline, GD arrived 5,000 years ago. I spoke of the Abyss, it's a spilling of ink that has affected all pages. He said we would keep our free will if we want it, agrees we would be more helpful. As long as we're out of the way and wont hinder him, he'll give us the locket. If we agree to help, he'll give us something else.
		- Rem was against it. Valindra asked what if we lied. He said that he's peaceful but his beastmen aren't and will come after us. Rem asked what if we want no gods, for the people to rule. LG says we're incapable. People are prone to warfare and violence. 
	- He took off one of his hands and offered it to us, holding an amulet. The hand is the other extra gift. Said all will be revealed with the truth, we may change our minds. 
		- An oath sworn upon the hand of the Living God 
			- Curse: An oath sworn upon this item by a creature attuning to it will bind the artifact to them. This item cannot be removed forcibly, and will kill the wearer instantly if they intentioanlly take it off. The soul of the creature is immediately imprisioned inside the artifact from which only its creator can release.
	- GD is chained but LG doesn't have forever to stay here. The essence of these artifacts are required to kill gods, anything that has the essence of an outer plane.
			- Rem and I would need a boost to be eligible via an item
		- Rem said he wouldn't swear anything, if LG was truly a representative of peace 
	- I asked about my son and husband. They are both dead. Xchimaltia, goddess of death has their souls. I expressed my gratitude for him, said I would work with him. Asked if I serve him well, to reunite my souls with the others. He agreed.
- Rita and Sally had returned. 
	- Rem and Lewis talked to them. Sally doesn't want to become one of them. She came with us. Rita is convulsing in silence.
- We returned to the house.
	- LG's hand turned into a piece of golden jewelry. Requires attunement over a short rest. I didn't attune to it but learned about it. 
	- Loot - 
		- Half Plate of the Dead
			- While wearing this armor, you can use it to cast either Speak with Dead or Animate Dead. Once the armor has cast a spell in this way, it can't cast either spell until the next dawn. Your soul keeps this armor together. If you die while you are attuned to the armor, the armor is destroyed.  The wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
	- Javelin of Lightning
	- Pearl of Power
	- ![[Pasted image 20250601215646.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250601220852.png]]
	- Pearl went to Ria, I gave the hand to Lewis, Valindra got the Javelin, Rem got the half plate and the heart.
- Rem went to talk with Sally outside, tender moment. Said he truly doesn't think there's a good option. Spoke of his family and village, and the treatment. Said there wasn't any good options. Spoke of killing her.
	- Sally asked what if his mother was right. Asked what he would do. Rem said he would choose to die. She said freedom to be herself. Not feel trapped anymore. But she's not ready yet. He said that she risked being trapped in her own body. 
	- I stepped out and told him I can do it painlessly. Rem hugged her and let it happen. I summoned an illusion of Rita who came back cured, told her it was going to be alright and the beastmen had told the truth, wrapped her in a hug with Rem, tilted her chin up, kissed her, poisonous taste. We euthanized Sally.
- Lewis's msg to Theron
	- Theron we have been meeting stiff resistance at Barca there is no easy way into the city. is there any word on other lost items?
- Level up to lvl 5
