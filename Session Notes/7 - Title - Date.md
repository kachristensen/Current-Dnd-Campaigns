## Notes
- Prayer of Healing  
  - We sent Sally home, she said to continue to head northwest.  
  - Ria asked for alternate paths, she’s not sure how to explain.   
  - We gathered the bodies inside. Valindra revived Wuffi, it melded into her shadow, I asked her about necromancy – Wuffi is a spirit, she just resummoned him.   
  - Ria suggested we burn the place for cover, GFB  
  - Rem suggested Valindra follow a battle plan in the future, conversation about minimizing her taking dmg, but encouraged her to speak up and offer ideas  
- Travelling NW, successful stealth, made it to the temple  
  - Found lots of prisoners outside it in cages  
  - We retreated to a nearby house for cover  
    - Rem suggested Lewis craft better armor  
    - 1We talked about the prisoners, infected, freeing them? We talked about plans, going to keep watch the rest of the night, then rest during the day. The boys are staying to work on Lewis’s improvements. Wuffi is staying with them \+ Ria.   
  - Valindra and I headed over back to the prisoners to keep watch  
    - One cage of plague victims, possibly Sally’s mom there  
    - Alfira, my obscura contact, is not there  
    - Prisoners sleeping, beastmen chilling, speaking in Draconic. More active watch closer to daytime  
    - One armored beastman dude near the entrance to the temple. Only one of his kind.  
      - Perimeter check around the temple closer to dawn. There are packs & groups all around the temple, HQ. Well guarded all around.   
      - We found a street walled off, MASSIVE giant feral beast thing there, seems wilder/more aggressive – they’re throwing food/scraps into its giant pen   
  - Day watch \- we saw big massive guy being walked around in chains, patrols. Ria suggested we could release it for havoc.  
    - I asked Lewis to make manacles/muzzle for a beastman prisoner. He was able to make manacles but can only do one at a time.  
- Next night \- prisoner fight
