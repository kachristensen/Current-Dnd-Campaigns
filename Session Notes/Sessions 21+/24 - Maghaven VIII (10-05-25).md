## Notes
- We killed Agnes, it exploded
	- I took her head and some crystals, we found her notes, diary, schematics, wine
	- Lewis harvested some material from the golem
	- Ria's scales are visible through her torn clothes, thick bronze draconic scales
- Rem and Wuffi and I flew up to the top of the clock tower, I showed him Agnes's head, he has a massive hulking construct. The Bell Beast. He handed us 3.5k. 
- Leaving Maghaven 
	- We came across Vera. We debated about what to do, Valindra set Wuffi to collect her, he allowed her to mount him.
	- Prayer of Healing from Rem
	- Valindra seemed disturbed by the chains wrapped around her neck from before. Vera asked where we were headed to, Valindra said away.
	- Vera wanted to stick with us, Rem rebuffed her. 
	- Rem suggested in exchange for the dragon heart, she cover their tracks. She agreed. As a show of friendship, she offered Valindra the first bite. Valindra accepted.
- We travelled northward, forced march through the next day.
	- Made it to the temple
		- Some movement, low to the ground, long and flat. I spoke animals, hungry creatures in there.
	- Perse asked Rem to check in on the ladies, he ripped the arm out of the bracer and chucked it.
	- Perse boiled the bracer and Agnes's head down to the skull, saving some meat sludge for the animals. Lewis and I stayed up, we identified the bracer. 1 level of exhaustion but without the reduced speed effect, just does the other stuff.
	- I busted out the tome, tried to dispel the lock and chain. I felt like the key to the lock was a specific spell, requires Knock specifically. Could dispel it possibly but need higher than a 15.
	- Lewis asked about my son, was gentle, I told him he was taken from me and then at some point died. Said the LG told me what I wanted to know. He said he could try to speak to St Imelda during this temple. I told Lewis I wanted to know what sort of life he lived. He asked for my son's name. Zagreus. 
		- I told Lewis I was concerned about his quick attachments, he never had anyone else. He was quiet and tended to his work. His only friend was the hammer and iron. 
		- We talked more, I said he was a good person, he said likewise. I asked if he would really deliver the artifacts to the Rexum, he said yeah, looking at other paths though, the bigger picture, not so narrow minded.
			- I toasted him with wine. 
			- He suggested we summon Porto, Perse joked some, but said she wouldn't like to give the serum to them, the demons might do something crazy.
			- Lewis caught movement in the trees, glowing red eyes.
	- Perse and Ria talked, Perse asked if she was going to break, unleash soon. She said that was always the plan, has a target. Someone with history in her life,  I asked if we could help, said revenge stories could be fun. Said we'll have to survive long enough to return to the capital, they've taken much from her. She'll be disappointed Ria's not dead by now. Thief and a murderer. She will burn everything she's built around herself, everything she's stolen, all the complacent individuals who let her get away with it. I asked what they did to her. She never loved her, stole her childhood, murdered your childhood, poisoned her sister against her, sent her away, stole her birthright. Her mother. 
		- Cordelia Drakesbane, loyalist, remarried. She married into the family, the new husband and son are not Drakesbanes but have the name.
		- I gave her a side hug. Said we would help. She isn't going to kill her quietly. Bloody coup. She had intended to forge friendships/alliances to turn against her. Her sister was sent to the clergy. She's not sure where to find her. I suggested she let her guard down around us. Told her she was scary when she talked about murdering Valindra with intensity. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and went to bed. Woke up Valindra.
		- Noticed Porto outside
