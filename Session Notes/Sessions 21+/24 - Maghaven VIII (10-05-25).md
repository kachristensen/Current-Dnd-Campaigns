## Summary


## IC Synopsis -
> Perse’s voice cut through the chaos  “Ria and I will take the nanny!”  and in an instant the battlefield was divided. Rem and Valindra surged forward, intercepting Agnes’s monstrous construct as I slipped from view, calling upon divinity to heal Valindra’s wounds, light spilling between my fingers.
   Anicca darted forward but took a heavy hit!  The golem’s arm swung like a battering ram, air cracking from the force. Rem and Valindra dove aside, the impact shattering stone where they’d stood only moments before. The nanny creature writhed, dragging its twisted frame toward the ceiling, joints screeching as it clambered higher, out of earshot and out of Sight (I only hope those two can take care of it, they were both badly wounded)
   Rem growled through gritted teeth as I sent healing energy into him, closing the gashes torn by Agnes’s monstrous creation. Anicca vanished in a shimmer of light just as Agnes brought her metallic arm down with a thunderous crash that left the air humming.
   Rem and Valindra pressed the assault, blades flashing and sparks dancing across the golem’s fractured shell. The construct staggered as Rem struck true, landing a devastating, bone-rattling blow that sent cracks racing across its body. Valindra followed with ruthless precision, her weapon finding the same fault lines, widening them with every strike.
   And then — the world shook.
   Agnes screamed, fury and desperation mingling as she unleashed a final command. The golem convulsed, glowing veins splitting open in arcs of unstable energy. We barely had time to brace before it erupted in a blinding explosion of fire and stone. A final, violent bang that marked the end of the battle.
   Silence followed, broken only by the sound of dust settling… and our own ragged breaths
   We ransacked Agnes’s office once the chaos settled. Ria and Rem grabbed her notes, Perse snatched some wine and a handful of blue crystals, and I took about forty pounds of good metal—enough to forge something worthwhile.
   Rem wrapped Ria in his cloak to hide her wounds and scales. We slipped out under Valindra’s Pass Without Trace and made for the Clocktower.
   Perse cast Fly on Anicca, and she and Rem went up to meet Lucious. Some monstrous construct—bells hanging from every limb—stood guard while Grubb handled the exchange. Perse found the rest of the platinum, confirmed Agnes was dead, and showed Grubb her head for proof. Grim business, but necessary.
   On our way out of town, we spotted Vera. She didn’t see us at first, but Wuffi went to her, and soon she caught up. Rem offered a Prayer of Healing, which helped more than I’d admit. Ria and Rem turned Vera away but handed her the dragon heart to keep others off our trail. Valindra joined her in eating it again—said it didn’t taste as good this time. Maybe it’s lost its magic… or they’ve just changed.
   Vera noticed Ria wearing Rem’s cloak. I pretended not to.
   We skirted a small hamlet and pushed north, forcing a march toward the ruined temple. Wuffi scouted ahead—spotted movement in the brush. I’ll admit, I wasn’t ready to face whatever waited inside. Perse went invisible and used her magic to speak with the beasts—said they were hungry and there was more than one.
   Rem later took the bracer off Agnes’s severed arm and tossed it away from camp. Good riddance. Handing the bracer to perse rem goes to sleep with the others. Perse and I boil an interesting stew of bracer and mystery meat for our new friends come the next dawn.  I took the liberty at identifying the bracer. 
   Perse seemed more relaxed and willing to talk if worded things correctly. Trying not to be straight forward but with a bit of curiosity and being delicate i asked perse about her son. As time went on she could see that I was sad for her loss and was pushing for a name. What I learned that night  is that she was a caring and grieving mother.  Zagreus was very young when he was taken from her grasp. Perse had done all that she could to protect him, however her struggle to keep him close was only they beginning as she could not find or hear anything from him. I told perse i would try to learn of her son who he was, what he did, and how long he lived.
   Perse again tells me that I am too trusting though we have a high caliber of people.  She may be right… I have clung to my new group like a babe clinging to his mother.  Its is my job and my duty to keep them alive. (I will always grind at a grind stone if it means to sharpen a blade).
   Our watch ends as the time ticks by ever so quickly… (I see you lurking in the trees flying from branch to branch) Perse we have eyes watching us. Be on guard and wake me if you need anything.
   ((Ria drops lore!!!!!!)) lewis doesnt know, lewis doesnt know, Dont tell lewis!
   Shhhh Porto's is here!

## Notes
- We killed Agnes, it exploded
	- I took her head and some crystals, we found her notes, diary, schematics, wine
	- Lewis harvested some material from the golem
	- Ria's scales are visible through her torn clothes, thick bronze draconic scales
- Rem and Wuffi and I flew up to the top of the clock tower, I showed him Agnes's head, he has a massive hulking construct. The Bell Beast. He handed us 3.5k. 
- Leaving Maghaven 
	- We came across Vera. We debated about what to do, Valindra set Wuffi to collect her, he allowed her to mount him.
	- Prayer of Healing from Rem
	- Valindra seemed disturbed by the chains wrapped around her neck from before. Vera asked where we were headed to, Valindra said away.
	- Vera wanted to stick with us, Rem rebuffed her. 
	- Rem suggested in exchange for the dragon heart, she cover their tracks. She agreed. As a show of friendship, she offered Valindra the first bite. Valindra accepted.
- We travelled northward, forced march through the next day.
	- Made it to the temple
		- Some movement, low to the ground, long and flat. I spoke animals, hungry creatures in there.
	- Perse asked Rem to check in on the ladies, he ripped the arm out of the bracer and chucked it.
	- Perse boiled the bracer and Agnes's head down to the skull, saving some meat sludge for the animals. Lewis and I stayed up, we identified the bracer. 1 level of exhaustion but without the reduced speed effect, just does the other stuff.
	- I busted out the tome, tried to dispel the lock and chain. I felt like the key to the lock was a specific spell, requires Knock specifically. Could dispel it possibly but need higher than a 15.
	- Lewis asked about my son, was gentle, I told him he was taken from me and then at some point died. Said the LG told me what I wanted to know. He said he could try to speak to St Imelda during this temple. I told Lewis I wanted to know what sort of life he lived. He asked for my son's name. Zagreus. 
		- I told Lewis I was concerned about his quick attachments, he never had anyone else. He was quiet and tended to his work. His only friend was the hammer and iron. 
		- We talked more, I said he was a good person, he said likewise. I asked if he would really deliver the artifacts to the Rexum, he said yeah, looking at other paths though, the bigger picture, not so narrow minded.
			- I toasted him with wine. 
			- He suggested we summon Porto, Perse joked some, but said she wouldn't like to give the serum to them, the demons might do something crazy.
			- Lewis caught movement in the trees, glowing red eyes.
	- Perse and Ria talked, Perse asked if she was going to break, unleash soon. She said that was always the plan, has a target. Someone with history in her life,  I asked if we could help, said revenge stories could be fun. Said we'll have to survive long enough to return to the capital, they've taken much from her. She'll be disappointed Ria's not dead by now. Thief and a murderer. She will burn everything she's built around herself, everything she's stolen, all the complacent individuals who let her get away with it. I asked what they did to her. She never loved her, stole her childhood, murdered your childhood, poisoned her sister against her, sent her away, stole her birthright. Her mother. 
		- Cordelia Drakesbane, loyalist, remarried. She married into the family, the new husband and son are not Drakesbanes but have the name.
		- I gave her a side hug. Said we would help. She isn't going to kill her quietly. Bloody coup. She had intended to forge friendships/alliances to turn against her. Her sister was sent to the clergy. She's not sure where to find her. I suggested she let her guard down around us. Told her she was scary when she talked about murdering Valindra with intensity. I gave her a kiss on the cheek and went to bed. Woke up Valindra.
		- Noticed Porto outside
