## Notes
- We killed Agnes, it exploded
	- I took her head and some crystals, we found her notes, diary, schematics, wine
	- Lewis harvested some material from the golem
	- Ria's scales are visible through her torn clothes, thick bronze draconic scales
- Rem and Wuffi and I flew up to the top of the clock tower, I showed him Agnes's head, he has a massive hulking construct. The Bell Beast. He handed us 3.5k. 
- Leaving Maghaven 
	- We came across Vera. We debated about what to do, Valindra set Wuffi to collect her, he allowed her to mount him.
	- Prayer of Healing from Rem
	- Valindra seemed disturbed by the chains wrapped around her neck from before. Vera asked where we were headed to, Valindra said away.
	- Vera wanted to stick with us, Rem rebuffed her. 
	- Rem suggested in exchange for the dragon heart, she cover their tracks. She agreed. As a show of friendship, she offered Valindra the first bite. Valindra accepted.
- We travelled northward, forced march through the next day.
	- Made it to the temple
		- Some movement, low to the ground, long and flat. I spoke animals, hungry creatures in there.
	- Perse asked Rem to check in on the ladies, he ripped the arm out of the bracer and chucked it.
	- Perse boiled the bracer and Agnes's head down to the skull, saving some meat sludge for the animals. Lewis and I stayed up, we identified the bracer. 1 level of exhaustion but without the reduced speed effect, just does the other stuff.
	- I busted out the tome, tried to dispel the lock and chain. I felt like the key to the lock was a specific spell, requires Knock specifically. Could dispel it possibly but need higher than a 15.
	- Lewis asked about my son, was gentle, I told him he was taken from me and then at some point died. Said the LG told me what I wanted to know. He said he could try to speak to St Imelda during this temple. I told Lewis I wanted to know what sort of life he lived. He asked for my son's name. Zagreus. 
		- I told Lewis I was concerned about his quick attachments, he never had anyone else. He was quiet and tended to his work. His only friend was the hammer and iron. 
		- We talked more, I said he was a good person, he said likewise. I asked if he would really deliver the artifacts to the Rexum, he said yeah, looking at other paths though, the bigger picture, not so narrow minded.
