## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone

## Notes
- Post dragon fight
	- Lewis came over to heal Perse, she freaked out - PTSD back to her last death, burning, said they killed him, took her son, etc. She hugged him and cried.
		- Ria prestidigitated the acid off
	- Vera walked over to Rem, intrigued by him, asked him if he wanted to do the honors and claim his kill. She tried to get him to dissect it, Rem disagreed/encouraged Valindra instead.
		- Valindra removed the heart, Rem carried it.
	- Loot - 6.3k gold, ring of jumping, animated shield, figurine of wondrous power/golden lions, mace of disruption, staff of swarming insects, 350gp in gems, lavender tome with a lock and chain (cursed?).
