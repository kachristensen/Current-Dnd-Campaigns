## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
>**What Once Was Mine**
	There are agonies that defy belief
	There are screams that transcend time
	No sharper pain than that of grief
	For the loss of what once was mine
	/
	Acid burns and vision wanes
	Flesh tears and blood stains
	We cannot hide, we cannot run
	They kill him first, then take our son
	/
	This man I cling to is not him
	Rip, tear, rend limb from limb
	He holds and heals and I do not die
	He soothes and comforts while I cry
	/
	Valindra crafts a salve to proffer
	Vera becomes Rem's new stalker
	We claim heart and scale and dragon's hoard
	Whereupon she departs in desirous accord
	/
	At night we decide to keep the Hand
	Rem and Ria soar across the land
	Lewis and her hold colors in esteem
	Valindra and I muse what it is to dream
	/
	We return to Mayor Sabine of Maghaven
	And ponder the offer of Lucious the Craven
	Turning down a reward, we instead inquire
	For her to arrange the meeting required
	/
	Lewis and Rem head to the temple to pray
	Returning with cloak and backwards beret
	Agnes responds with her choice of the stage
	We finalize our plans before we engage
	/
	And all the while drifting from lie to lie
	In the hopes I forget what once was mine


## Notes
- Post dragon fight / short rest
	- Lewis came over to heal Perse, she freaked out - PTSD back to her last death, burning, said they killed him, took her son, etc. She hugged him and cried.
		- Ria prestidigitated the acid off
	- Vera walked over to Rem, intrigued by him, asked him if he wanted to do the honors and claim his kill. She tried to get him to dissect it, Rem disagreed/encouraged Valindra instead. She was all horny n shit, Rem was cold/dismissive.
		- Valindra removed the heart, Rem carried it.
	- Loot - 6.3k gold, ring of jumping, animated shield, figurine of wondrous power/golden lions, mace of disruption, staff of swarming insects, 350gp in gems, lavender tome with a lock and chain (cursed?).
	- Valindra came to check up on me & Lewis, mentioned she had a remedy. Went to the woods, birch bark/pine resin, crushed into ointment. She applied it to me, I thanked her.
	- Valindra and Lewis harvested some scales
	- Rem went outside to tend to Anicca, Vera was there, wanted to know more about him, said he had interesting/predatory/wild eyes. She asked what his plans were. He said continue on. She asked if he craved blood. He said he seems to find it. She mentioned he and her could be a team, killing dragons, support of the Fontaines. He turned her down. She said she'd be lingering nearby for the night.
	- Ria cast Fly on Anicca, Rem took Ria for a ride.
	- Perse cast Tiny Hut
		- Rem suggested we bring the dragon head back to Maghaven, make a show of it. He mentioned that going back in quietly might be better vs. Agnes. Rem is hoping they can at least speak first before striking her down.
		- Lewis held out the hand of the Living God, said he didn't want to hold on to it any longer. I said I'd hold onto it if no one else wanted it, could be useful, safer if we hold on to it. Ria suggested he put it in the bag of holding. Lewis agreed.
		- Watch
			- Lewis and Ria - lewis asked if Ria liked the color black, preferred color? She said meh. Lewis's favorite is green. 
			- Valindra and Perse snuggled, Perse asked if she ever wished she could dream, we talked through a fantasy story together of a child adventuring with dragons and a mystery.
- Next day
	- Ria thanked us for negotiating with Grubb, she said she is more soldier than noble, hasn't been in court since a young child. Ria's been in the army/surgers for 15 years, sent when she was 12.
	- Returned to Mayor Sabine
		- In exchange for us killing the dragon, Rem asked for her to arrange a meeting with Agnes within 3 days. Ria and Rem turned down a monetary reward.
		- Ria asked about Molly, she's a gift from Agnes herself. 
	- Rem and Lewis went to the church
		- Meta: visited Erasmus, Lewis showed him a dragon scale, gifted it to him.
		- Rem felt a strange feeling when passing the statue of Zarunok, like someone was watching him. Reminded him of Taryn.
		- Lewis prayed to St. Imelda, wants to make her proud. Portrait exuded approval.
		- They visited Gideon the tailor again, Lewis looking for an interchangeable cloak, red on one side, black on the other. He offered it for a massive discount of 300g, Rem negotiated it down to 200g. Threw in a cap for free, Lewis put it on backwards.
	- Girls
		- Molly had a message for us, Agnes wants to choose the meeting place.
		- Rem discussed a rendezvous point if we get separated
		- Perse sent a letter to Grubb to be on standbuy
- Homebrew - Invis gives disadvantage to perception checks to detect
