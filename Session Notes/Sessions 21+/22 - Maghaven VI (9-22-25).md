## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> 

## Notes
- Post dragon fight / short rest
	- Lewis came over to heal Perse, she freaked out - PTSD back to her last death, burning, said they killed him, took her son, etc. She hugged him and cried.
		- Ria prestidigitated the acid off
	- Vera walked over to Rem, intrigued by him, asked him if he wanted to do the honors and claim his kill. She tried to get him to dissect it, Rem disagreed/encouraged Valindra instead. She was all horny n shit, Rem was cold/dismissive.
		- Valindra removed the heart, Rem carried it.
	- Loot - 6.3k gold, ring of jumping, animated shield, figurine of wondrous power/golden lions, mace of disruption, staff of swarming insects, 350gp in gems, lavender tome with a lock and chain (cursed?).
	- Valindra came to check up on me & Lewis, mentioned she had a remedy. Went to the woods, birch bark/pine resin, crushed into ointment. She applied it to me, I thanked her.
	- Valindra and Lewis harvested some scales
	- Rem went outside to tend to Anicca, Vera was there, wanted to know more about him, said he had interesting/predatory/wild eyes. She asked what his plans were. He said continue on. She asked if he craved blood. He said he seems to find it. She mentioned he and her could be a team, killing dragons, support of the Fontaines. He turned her down. She said she'd be lingering nearby for the night.
	- Ria cast Fly on Anicca, Rem took Ria for a ride.
	- Perse cast Tiny Hut
		- Rem suggested we bring the dragon head back to Maghaven, make a show of it. He mentioned that going back in quietly might be better vs. Agnes. Rem is hoping they can at least speak first before striking her down.
		- Lewis held out the hand of the Living God, said he didn't want to hold on to it any longer. I said I'd hold onto it if no one else wanted it, could be useful, safer if we hold on to it. Ria suggested he put it in the bag of holding. Lewis agreed.
		- Watch
			- Lewis and Ria - lewis asked if Ria liked the color black, preferred color? She said meh. Lewis's favorite is green. 
			- Valindra and Perse snuggled, Perse asked if she ever wished she could dream, we talked through a fantasy story together of a child adventuring with dragons and a mystery.
- Next day
	- Ria thanked us for negotiating with Grubb, she said she is more soldier than noble, hasn't been in court since a young child. Ria's been in the army/surgers for 15 years, sent when she was 12.
