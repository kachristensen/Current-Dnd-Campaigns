## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone


## Notes
- Prayer of Healing
	- Bardic Inspiration on Lewis
	- Enemies start to decay/sludge on death
- Door to the next room - stone, exudes a feeling of weakness - losing hp aura. Loud wail, exhaustion to Wuffi.
	- Altar with egg, candles, food. Egg has burst open. 2 Human bodies webbed. Baby humanoid insect bee thing at the edge of the table, eating flesh. Wail - exhaustion to many of us. Valindra silenced it. Bug did the uppies motion. Rem killed it.
	- Corpses - human male and female, 20s. Were living until an hour ago, freshly dead. Egg recently hatched. 
	- Mural - has been painted over, instead of St. Imelda, is XI'Talla. Crowds and masses of screaming writhing humans, giant bug goddess, burning flames and smoke. 
	- Ria and I arcana'd - egg is the same one we saw in the sewers of Maghaven. Hybrid between human and insect, tainted, trying to be grown as a vessel, but came out deformed. Method is trying to be perfected.
	- Lewis cast speak with dead
		- How long have you been captured? 
			- I don't know what you mean.
		- You were a part of this ritual?
			- Indeed.
		- What was the point of building this settlement underneath the temple?
			- To be closer to her.
		- Was there anything inside the temple worth grabbing?
			- Just the priestess, I suppose.
		- Where is the priestess now?
			- I don't know.
		- Corpse continued to look at Lewis and speak with him even after the 5 questions. 
			- What were your plans for the priestess?
				- The lady of the temple became part of the hive and administered the final rites. 
				- "Lewis, your mother is calling."
			- Where is my mother?
				- She sleeps below. She awaits for her children to wake her up. Please wake me up, Lewis. 
			- And how would I wake you up?
				- repeated - please wake me up Lewis.
			- Lewis brained it with his mace. Tore down the painting and lit it afire. 
	- Rem looked for buttons/hidden passageways. This section is part of the temple but was cemented off long ago.
	- Perse cut off the head of the heirophant and put it in the bag of holding
	- Burned all and left the temple
- We returned to Porto
	- Lewis asked Rem about an item that should've been the temple, they didn't see it. Thanked him for looking.
	- Porto has been scribing weird symbols into the ground. Surprised we came back so quickly. 
		- Abyssal - can't tell much more about the ritual. Communication ritual. 
		- Needs about as much blood as an adult human, must be mortal. 
			- Valindra went hunting, Perse assisted with Bardic Inspo. Valindra took down a young elk. 
				- Porto says good for 80%, will need some extra blood.
				- Valindra was very willing, Perse squinted at her.
				- Ria has no objections so long as the circle is disposed of.
				- Lewis was willing, took out a dagger.
				- Rem abstained.
	- Ritual - we dripped the remaining blood. Porto pulled out a mirror. Needs a person to touch it, Perse touched it. 
		- Temperature dropped in the circle, a voice.
			- Mastenovti asked if I was familiar with him. I said perhaps.
			- He needs a group of powerful individuals. Asked why our interest in powerful artifacts. Said the items we seek are connected to the gods. The essence that makes them what they are are not solely of divine, he can make them as well. What he needs to craft such an item is the body of a powerful demon. Competition. Wants us to take out a rival of his. Pick one of the remaining three.
				- I questioned why they haven't unified, can only be through conquest.
				- The humans aren't important, need to get rid of the gods who are holding back the essence of the abyss. Have grown stale from lack of contact.
					- He was trying to fish why he was familiar with me - I told him he should look to his history books/memory. He asked Porto to describe me to him, they conferred in Abyssal. 
					- He says my husband is betrothed to Xchi'maltia. His kingdom has been left to an inferior, let it rot. All of his rivals live in the underdark. We'll need to meet in person to discuss - deliver the body of his rival and craft the weapon. 
					- I told them we would speak again. 
				- Party conversed. I told them of my history and Hades. Dying, resurrecting in the mountains in the northwest. 
		- I asked as a favor that they come with. Lewis was with me, as was Valindra. 
			- META: Ria wondering if my joy is blinding me. Jim asked Chris about what he knows of visiting the underworld -- its a fantasy, no one goes there unless worshipping demons, heretical. Asked about marriage, gods are supposedly infertile, forbidden from having offspring. Ely asked about demon couples - era was very competitive, used humans as proxies for war, had alliances but those usually crumbled. Not out of the question for there to be romantic alliances. 
		- Rem seems reserved, guarded. Said has reservations about the Rexum but wants no part in upending the Grand Divine. Would be fine to slay a demon lord, but Mastenovti's plans are concerning. 
		- Porto said he knows of a path to get there. 
			- Verlatenland, former city is said to have fallen into the Abyss long ago, considered a portal to hell.
			- Valindra dropped Valdrheim, Porto recommended we visit beforehand.
			- Long way over the river would be like a month of travel. Porto knows a way that would be faster, closer here.
- Tiny Hut
	- We discussed what to do next. Decided to inform Theron. Rem wants to be cured before we visit Mastenovti.
	- Perse asked Valindra why she speaks Abyssal. 
		- All in the Veridian Scales can speak Abyssal. Their stories/histories came from the demons, the one who wrote them down. When they're told to them, they're spoken in Abyssal. Draconic was left to the higher ranking more devout.  The dragons spoke oral history, destroyed a lot of the demons, so those who knew the histories of the demons preserved it. Demons kept very detailed records. 
	- Lewis sent message to Theron - Agnes is dead, bracer is ours, dolls may not be in surplus. What other artifacts are available for procurement?
		- Theron asked about the heart, Lewis said it was still out of reach. We're coming up with a better plan for future endeavor.
			- 2 Artifacts in Valdrheim - shield and chains. Shield of Forsherey. Chains of Zaronach. Valdrheim has seen a massive increase in spirits due to concentration of artifacts - full frontal assault not practical. 
			- Theron asked if he should send someone to pick up artifacts, Lewis said we'll bring back none or all as agreed.
		- Valindra asked what my husband's name was, Hades. Her history books do mention him. 
		- Rem wants to go to Valdrheim, said he'd never go to the underworld. 
		- Ria said we are less beholden to Mastenovti than the Rexum. 
		- I said I don't mind going to Valdrheim first, but if we don't ever go to the underdark, I will part ways with them.  Lewis said he was with me, as did Valindra. 
	- I failed dispelling the tome again, Rem Enhanced Abilitied me.
- Watches
	- Ria and Lewis
		- Lewis pulled some brain matter out of the skull of the hierophant. Said he was preparing for tomorrow, a spell. Ria asked what. He wants to know why she turned/gave up. Ria said the entity's influence spreads like an infection, said to take care it doesn't root itself in him. She'd have to kill him. Lewis said he'll consume the mind of that person. Ria asked why. He said he'd sit on it. Ria warned against the corruption. Lewis asked for our support in the morning. Ria called him stupid.
			- Grim Hollow - Consume Mind spell
	- Valindra and Ria
		- not much to say - Ria seems irritated. Valindra asked for tea. 
	- Valindra and Perse
		- She asked about my history, what it was like. I told her much about it. Love, ruling, our son. 
		- We talked about Rem some. Hugged. Said in our long lives we would be friends.
	- Rem and Perse
		- Terse conversation, Rem said Perse had plenty of opportunities to confide in him. She said he wasn't ready and he's treated her rudely since then.
		- He asked why he should. Perse cried and yelled at him, said he needs us on the same side. Said she was sorry. She loves her husband and wants to find out what happened to him. She likes this party.
