## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone


## Notes
- Prayer of Healing
	- Bardic Inspiration on Lewis
	- Enemies start to decay/sludge on death
- Door to the next room - stone, exudes a feeling of weakness - losing hp aura. Loud wail, exhaustion to Wuffi.
	- Altar with egg, candles, food. Egg has burst open. 2 Human bodies webbed. Baby humanoid insect bee thing at the edge of the table, eating flesh. Wail - exhaustion to many of us. Valindra silenced it. Bug did the uppies motion. Rem killed it.
	- Corpses - human male and female, 20s. Were living until an hour ago, freshly dead. Egg recently hatched. 
	- Mural - has been painted over, instead of St. Imelda, is XI'Talla. Crowds and masses of screaming writhing humans, giant bug goddess, burning flames and smoke. 
	- Ria and I arcana'd - egg is the same one we saw in the sewers of Maghaven. Hybrid between human and insect, tainted, trying to be grown as a vessel, but came out deformed. Method is trying to be perfected.
	- Lewis cast speak with dead
		- How long have you been captured? 
			- I don't know what you mean.
		- You were a part of this ritual?
			- Indeed.
		- What was the point of building this settlement underneath the temple?
			- To be closer to her.
		- Was there anything inside the temple worth grabbing?
			- Just the priestess, I suppose.
		- Where is the priestess now?
			- I don't know.
		- Corpse continued to look at Lewis and speak with him even after the 5 questions. 
			- What were your plans for the priestess?
				- The lady of the temple became part of the hive and administered the final rites. 
				- "Lewis, your mother is calling."
			- Where is my mother?
				- She sleeps below. She awaits for her children to wake her up. Please wake me up, Lewis. 
			- And how would I wake you up?
				- repeated - please wake me up Lewis.
			- Lewis brained it with his mace. Tore down the painting and lit it afire.
