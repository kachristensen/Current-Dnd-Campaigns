## Notes
- We bid Agnes farewell, said we'd consider her offer to work with her.
- One guy stopped Valindra and said he had a proposition for us. We met downstairs in 10 minutes.
	- **Lucious Grubb** - a lower noble here.
		- Many of the nobles aren't a fan of her, she talks above her station, holds herself above the others. Says they are nobility for a reason, pure blood, gives them the right to be in charge, they don't like a civilian ruling over them. Concerned she's co-opting the rebellion into something else.
		- He asked why we were here, I introduced us as Lady Drakesbane's entourage. 
		- Told us about Maghaven's history, used to be more about arcane arts, but they've been sidelined. 
		- I suggested we talk more over dinner, he seemed excited. Doesn't think it would be wise to meet at his abode, wants to meet at the clocktower at 7pm. 
	- Rest of the meeting - the rebels want to pursue peace with the beastmen. 
	- I asked what Sabine knows of Lucious Grubb, says he's a pig, thinks highly of himself. Long line of sorcerers. Rude, boisterous. More interested in their name/history than the rebellion themselves. Losing glory. 
		- I asked where she stands. Agnes is a bit much, but she's all that keeps the city safe. She thinks strategically, Agnes is the better bet. The Dominion doesn't take prisoners, kill all. 
		- She doesn't know how she creates them. She does know where her primary warehouse is done. The nobles fund her/give materials. 
		- I asked if we could swing by the warehouse, said Lady Drakesbane was interested. She said she'd give us the location but didn't want to cause any trouble. 
			- Molly can assist us with access to whatever we need.
- We visited Agnes's warehouse, got a tour.
	- Crystal placed inside the automaton, power sources/battery.
		- Certain gems/stones can hold magical energy/be foci. Odd that there's so many, they take time to make.
		- New shipment arrives once a week ago. We examined the crate - it would have to arrive from somewhere with a lot of sorcerers or mages to create them. 
	- Construction is all done by workers, Agnes only makes blueprints/designs. Has a room in the back, doesn't visit as often.
	- Newer model, the Nanny, about to finish construction. Bigger, cage inside it. Capture, rather than kill. Burning furnace inside, can pour inside the cage. 
	- Lewis asked to look at a crystal. They can build 6-7 blade dolls a day. 
	- They're not sure how they obey commands, they just do.
	- No windows or skylights in the factory. Only the main opening. 
	- I paid the worker who gave us a tour 2g to stay silent. 
- Clocktower, dinner w/ Lucious
	- Perse didn't eat, Rem gorged himself. 
	- Asked if we were here to cause harm to dear Agnes. I said no, he alluded that we might be assassins. 
	- I asked how they would fare vs. the Dominion without Agnes, they said they could probably keep the operation running without her. They create the crystals for her.
		- Valindra suggested maybe she built a failsafe in the machines.
		- Lewis suggested maybe the dolls would turn against her. 
		- I suggested we learn more about the blade dolls' construction. He said a few of his colleagues have tried to reverse engineer them. They're powered by the crystals, put together by workers, then shipped out. Said he can assure us there's nothing we had to worry about.
