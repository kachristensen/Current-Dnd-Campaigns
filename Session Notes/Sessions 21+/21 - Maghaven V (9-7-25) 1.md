## Notes
- We bid Agnes farewell, said we'd consider her offer to work with her.
- One guy stopped Valindra and said he had a proposition for us. We met downstairs in 10 minutes.
	- **Lucious Grubb** - a lower noble here.
		- Many of the nobles aren't a fan of her, she talks above her station, holds herself above the others. Says they are nobility for a reason, pure blood, gives them the right to be in charge, they don't like a civilian ruling over them.
