## Notes
- We bid Agnes farewell, said we'd consider her offer to work with her.
- One guy stopped Valindra and said he had a proposition for us. We met downstairs in 10 minutes.
	- **Lucious Grubb** - a lower noble here.
		- Many of the nobles aren't a fan of her, she talks above her station, holds herself above the others. Says they are nobility for a reason, pure blood, gives them the right to be in charge, they don't like a civilian ruling over them. Concerned she's co-opting the rebellion into something else.
		- He asked why we were here, I introduced us as Lady Drakesbane's entourage. 
		- Told us about Maghaven's history, used to be more about arcane arts, but they've been sidelined. 
		- I suggested we talk more over dinner, he seemed excited. Doesn't think it would be wise to meet at his abode, wants to meet at the clocktower at 7pm. 
	- Rest of the meeting - the rebels want to pursue peace with the beastmen. 
	- I asked what Sabine knows of Lucious Grubb, says he's a pig, thinks highly of himself. Long line of sorcerers. Rude, boisterous. More interested in their name/history than the rebellion themselves. Losing glory. 
		- I asked where she stands. Agnes is a bit much, but she's all that keeps the city safe. She thinks strategically, Agnes is the better bet. The Dominion doesn't take prisoners, kill all. 
		- She doesn't know how she creates them. She does know where her primary warehouse is done. The nobles fund her/give materials. 
		- I asked if we could swing by the warehouse, said Lady Drakesbane was interested. She said she'd give us the location but didn't want to cause any trouble. 
			- Molly can assist us with access to whatever we need.
- We visited Agnes's warehouse, got a tour.
	- Crystal placed inside the automaton, power sources/battery.
		- Certain gems/stones can hold magical energy/be foci. Odd that there's so many, they take time to make.
		- New shipment arrives once a week ago. We examined the crate - it would have to arrive from somewhere with a lot of sorcerers or mages to create them. 
	- Construction is all done by workers, Agnes only makes blueprints/designs. Has a room in the back, doesn't visit as often.
	- Newer model, the Nanny, about to finish construction. Bigger, cage inside it. Capture, rather than kill. Burning furnace inside, can pour inside the cage. 
	- Lewis asked to look at a crystal. They can build 6-7 blade dolls a day. 
	- They're not sure how they obey commands, they just do.
	- No windows or skylights in the factory. Only the main opening. 
	- I paid the worker who gave us a tour 2g to stay silent. 
- Clocktower, dinner w/ Lucious
	- Perse didn't eat, Rem gorged himself. 
	- Asked if we were here to cause harm to dear Agnes. I said no, he alluded that we might be assassins. 
	- I asked how they would fare vs. the Dominion without Agnes, they said they could probably keep the operation running without her. They create the crystals for her.
		- Valindra suggested maybe she built a failsafe in the machines.
		- Lewis suggested maybe the dolls would turn against her. 
		- I suggested we learn more about the blade dolls' construction. He said a few of his colleagues have tried to reverse engineer them. They're powered by the crystals, put together by workers, then shipped out. Said he can assure us there's nothing we had to worry about. 
	- Wants us to make Agnes leave by whatever means possible, so that they can take control.
	- I asked if he could give us an edge, said he could arrange for an accident to take place in the workshop as a lure, we could meet with her there. 
	- He'll turn on us the moment it's advantageous, but right now is willing to work with us. 
	- I asked what he could offer, he said he noticed we were trying to trade, said we could have it. 
		- He said he'd provide us with a distraction. Said he'd clear the place out of the people, the machines will still be there but not active. He can guarantee we won't be blamed for it. 
	- He's funding this project himself, has others interested but he's alone in this. Offered 5,000g.
		- He tapped his cane on the ground and summoned two women, purple dresses/masks, mages? Says all of them are busy slaving away. These are his friends who can help, they were here the entire time, invisible.
		- I asked for 2k upfront, and his assistance. He gave us 1.5k upfront. We can meet him here afterwards for payment, safehouse up top at the clocktower. 
- We returned to Mayor Sabine's
	- Rem would prefer to avoid bloodshed. Lewis questioned what we're doing. Valindra thinks it will solve a lot of problems.
	- Rem suggested a middle ground - we pursue the dragon, use it to talk to Agnes, if she won't agree to trade the bracer then we proceed with Lucious's plan. 
	- Perse gave Valindra a big hug. 
	- Long rest
- We left to fight the dragon. Human tracks, Vera Fontaine's camp. We debated if we wanted to join her, we let Valindra decide. Valindra approached, thought it was a good idea. Vera is alone.
	- Her companions died. They found the dragon, it killed them then flew away to its lair. She does look roughed up/blistered. About a day and half ago. Offered to join us.
	- Valindra told her we have plans for the heart. Vera's open to also glory. We told her if we do consume the heart, we'd be open to sharing it with her.
		- She'll come with us. 
- Dragon lair
	- Voice called out to us, asked who approaches, in Draconic, deep voice. Valindra called out, asked if she could come learn more about it. It asked what she wants to know. She said she worships a dead dragon, wants to learn more about its brethren. Dragon asked if it wants to worship it. She said she wishes to understand who he is.
