## Summary
The party discussed eliminating Agnes per the offer of Lucious Grubb, a conservative mage and noble who wished to return Maghaven to the control of his ilk. They travelled to the black dragon's lair, picked up Vera, and slew it.

## IC Synopsis - As Relayed By Rem
> Perse excused us from our conversation with Agnes Welker without committing too much, but as we departed a hulking, overweight man leaning on a cane stopped Valindra and asked to speak with our group privately.  We agreed and our dialogue commenced ten minutes later on the lower level.  The man revealed himself to be Lucious Grubb, a noble longing for the days of arcane supremacy in Maghaven, and none too pleased to see Agnes’s industrialization of the city.  He revealed that he overheard our conversation with her, and not-so-subtly gauged our interest in removing Agnes entirely.  Lewis noted his shiftiness, but Perse proposed a dinner meeting so we could speak more freely.  Lucious eagerly agreed and we parted ways.
   We returned to our seats for the remainder of the meeting, which covered some high-level military discussions and plans.  Surely some of those in the room had a mind for such things, but I couldn’t help but feel it was a performance to keep the nobles content and their funds flowing.  When the meeting ended, Perse flagged down Sabine and asked her about Lucious.  Sabine minced no words, calling him a rude, boisterous pig, but also confirmed he hails from a long line of sorcerers well ingrained in Maghaven’s history.  Sabine did not seem much fonder of Agnes when she was mentioned, but acknowledged that her contributions to the war effort would be hard to replace.  Sabine shared the location of Agnes’s workshop with us, and offered continued accommodations while we stayed in the city.
   We passed by Lucious’s house on our way to Agnes’s workshop at Perse’s behest.  The factory was a strange building to my eye, dirty and noisy and industrial.  There was a great deal of traffic in and out of the one, large door to the building as we made our way inside.  Under the guise of a tour for Lady Drakesbane, Perse secured us a guide and we perused the building.  Though the assembly line workers knew little of the finer details regarding Agnes’s constructs, the visit still proved quite informative.  Agnes’s office was situated at the back of the building, but she rarely visited the workshop except to update blueprints and plans.  A new construct, the Nanny, had been completed and would soon be utilized in the field.  The workshop was capable of producing 6-7 Bladedolls per day, but its capacity of Nanny output had not been determined as of yet.  The power-supplying crystals were of particular note, but information on them was scarce.  As best as we could tell, they were being created by the nearby mage’s tower.  Perse tipped our guide 2 gold for his discretion as we departed for our meeting with Lucious.
   When we arrived at the Clocktower, Lucious greeted us with food in hand.  I made straight for the food to quell my ravenous hunger, while Perse abstained and insisted we get straight to business.  Lucious continued to feel us out, clearly interested in disposing of Agnes, or at the very least removing her from Maghaven.  He seemed ill prepared for any fallout from her demise, but did claim to have colleagues of his reverse engineering the constructs.  Such scheming and subterfuge is hardly my speciality, but I did my best to stomach it.  The food helped.  Perse led the negotiations and when she asked about any assistance with the plot, Lucious tapped his cane on the floor, prompting two hidden mages to reveal themselves.  He offered to provide a distraction when the time came, along with payment of 5,000 gold.  Perse secured an upfront portion of 1,500 gold before we parted ways.
   Our troupe returned to the civil complex serving as our abode to discuss our course of action.  Under Perse’s magical dome, Lewis questioned if we were really going to murder Agnes.  He also voiced his concerns about her removal and the effect it would have on the rebellion.  I suggested we pursue the dragon, and use the pretense of presenting Agnes with the dragon’s bounty to meet with her in a more private setting.  I suspect she will be unwilling to part with her artifact and it will likely come to violence, but I think it is worth the attempt, and if nothing else should serve to separate her from some of her constructs.  Some of the others likely harbor reservations about this course of action, but without a better alternative we proceeded with my plan.
   We rested in Perse’s dome and departed Maghaven early the next morning to hunt the black dragon plaguing the area.  With Valindra’s guidance and the map we procured from the cultists, we made the journey back in half a day’s time.  The first trail we found was not the dragon’s but Vera’s.  We considered bypassing her entirely, but ultimately approached her camp and found Vera alone and nursing herself back to health.  She told us that her companions had fallen in a skirmish with the dragon not two days past, but drove it back to its lair.  Valindra invited her to join us, but told her we had need of the heart.  Vera paused at that, but we convinced her that we’d share it with her down the line, if we did not need it for other purposes.  That proved to be enough, and with Vera in tow we made our way towards the dragon’s lair.
   An hour-long journey passed without issue, and a steep cliff separated us from the cave’s entrance.  Valindra scaled the wall with ease and helped us climb, all the while concealing our approach with magic.  It made little difference, however, as the dragon noted our entrance and called out to us as we encroached.  Valindra spoke, conveying her desire to learn from the dragon as we wandered into the cave.  The dragon probed us further and the deception did not last.  While we spoke, the dragon had snuck around towards the entrance and blocked us in.  We had prepared for battle with Lewis’s fortifications, Perse’s invisibility, and Wuffi’s adaptation to acid.  Perse highlighted the beast in magic as we tore into it with blades and bolts, both magic and mundane.  The dragon responded with its rending claws, swarms of insects, frightful roars, and breaths of acid, but we stood strong through it all.  I was able to land the killing blow, driving my radiant blade into its brain.  As I pulled my sword free, I turned to Vera and noted the excitement on her face.  For her sake, I hope she can contain such emotion and stay true to our deal.

## Notes
- We bid Agnes farewell, said we'd consider her offer to work with her.
- One guy stopped Valindra and said he had a proposition for us. We met downstairs in 10 minutes.
	- **Lucious Grubb** - a lower noble here.
		- Many of the nobles aren't a fan of her, she talks above her station, holds herself above the others. Says they are nobility for a reason, pure blood, gives them the right to be in charge, they don't like a civilian ruling over them. Concerned she's co-opting the rebellion into something else.
		- He asked why we were here, I introduced us as Lady Drakesbane's entourage. 
		- Told us about Maghaven's history, used to be more about arcane arts, but they've been sidelined. 
		- I suggested we talk more over dinner, he seemed excited. Doesn't think it would be wise to meet at his abode, wants to meet at the clocktower at 7pm. 
	- Rest of the meeting - the rebels want to pursue peace with the beastmen. 
	- I asked what Sabine knows of Lucious Grubb, says he's a pig, thinks highly of himself. Long line of sorcerers. Rude, boisterous. More interested in their name/history than the rebellion themselves. Losing glory. 
		- I asked where she stands. Agnes is a bit much, but she's all that keeps the city safe. She thinks strategically, Agnes is the better bet. The Dominion doesn't take prisoners, kill all. 
		- She doesn't know how she creates them. She does know where her primary warehouse is done. The nobles fund her/give materials. 
		- I asked if we could swing by the warehouse, said Lady Drakesbane was interested. She said she'd give us the location but didn't want to cause any trouble. 
			- Molly can assist us with access to whatever we need.
- We visited Agnes's warehouse, got a tour.
	- Crystal placed inside the automaton, power sources/battery.
		- Certain gems/stones can hold magical energy/be foci. Odd that there's so many, they take time to make.
		- New shipment arrives once a week ago. We examined the crate - it would have to arrive from somewhere with a lot of sorcerers or mages to create them. 
	- Construction is all done by workers, Agnes only makes blueprints/designs. Has a room in the back, doesn't visit as often.
	- Newer model, the Nanny, about to finish construction. Bigger, cage inside it. Capture, rather than kill. Burning furnace inside, can pour inside the cage. 
	- Lewis asked to look at a crystal. They can build 6-7 blade dolls a day. 
	- They're not sure how they obey commands, they just do.
	- No windows or skylights in the factory. Only the main opening. 
	- I paid the worker who gave us a tour 2g to stay silent. 
- Clocktower, dinner w/ Lucious
	- Perse didn't eat, Rem gorged himself. 
	- Asked if we were here to cause harm to dear Agnes. I said no, he alluded that we might be assassins. 
	- I asked how they would fare vs. the Dominion without Agnes, they said they could probably keep the operation running without her. They create the crystals for her.
		- Valindra suggested maybe she built a failsafe in the machines.
		- Lewis suggested maybe the dolls would turn against her. 
		- I suggested we learn more about the blade dolls' construction. He said a few of his colleagues have tried to reverse engineer them. They're powered by the crystals, put together by workers, then shipped out. Said he can assure us there's nothing we had to worry about. 
	- Wants us to make Agnes leave by whatever means possible, so that they can take control.
	- I asked if he could give us an edge, said he could arrange for an accident to take place in the workshop as a lure, we could meet with her there. 
	- He'll turn on us the moment it's advantageous, but right now is willing to work with us. 
	- I asked what he could offer, he said he noticed we were trying to trade, said we could have it. 
		- He said he'd provide us with a distraction. Said he'd clear the place out of the people, the machines will still be there but not active. He can guarantee we won't be blamed for it. 
	- He's funding this project himself, has others interested but he's alone in this. Offered 5,000g.
		- He tapped his cane on the ground and summoned two women, purple dresses/masks, mages? Says all of them are busy slaving away. These are his friends who can help, they were here the entire time, invisible.
		- I asked for 2k upfront, and his assistance. He gave us 1.5k upfront. We can meet him here afterwards for payment, safehouse up top at the clocktower. 
- We returned to Mayor Sabine's
	- Rem would prefer to avoid bloodshed. Lewis questioned what we're doing. Valindra thinks it will solve a lot of problems.
	- Rem suggested a middle ground - we pursue the dragon, use it to talk to Agnes, if she won't agree to trade the bracer then we proceed with Lucious's plan. 
	- Perse gave Valindra a big hug. 
	- Long rest
- We left to fight the dragon. Human tracks, Vera Fontaine's camp. We debated if we wanted to join her, we let Valindra decide. Valindra approached, thought it was a good idea. Vera is alone.
	- Her companions died. They found the dragon, it killed them then flew away to its lair. She does look roughed up/blistered. About a day and half ago. Offered to join us.
	- Valindra told her we have plans for the heart. Vera's open to also glory. We told her if we do consume the heart, we'd be open to sharing it with her.
		- She'll come with us. 
- Dragon lair
	- Voice called out to us, asked who approaches, in Draconic, deep voice. Valindra called out, asked if she could come learn more about it. It asked what she wants to know. She said she worships a dead dragon, wants to learn more about its brethren. Dragon asked if it wants to worship it. She said she wishes to understand who he is.
