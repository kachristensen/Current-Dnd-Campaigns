## Summary

## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> 

## Notes
- We killed the ruffians (assassins)? Black hooded uniforms. We investigated the bodies, their leader had orders to kill us by description, last known location (Maghaven) - suspected destination (town to the north), 500g per head, signed G. 
	- Corpse of Isolde here, killed with a slice to the neck. Was the Isolde we met earlier a fake? This one doesn't have anything we gave her. We buried her. Lewis cast Ceremony, funeral rites. 
- Perse suggested we skip Temut to avoid exposing them to danger, party discussed buying mounts in disguise.
	- Rem asked if Lewis had everything he needed for the cure, he said yes.
		- Perse asked if we should draw Rem's blood beforehand, he said we'd talk about it
- Later - Taryn appeared, walking towards us, smiled and waved. Seems like she was looking for us. She asked how our time in Maghaven was. I told her to get to the point.
	- She said she knows we're looking for things. She transformed into a huge devillish/angelic red-skinned woman, carrying a large golden scythe. Lewis admired her beautiful blade.
	- Rem said she seeks us out bc we seek her master's artifacts, she agreed. She wants our help in regaining an artifact. She's a servant of Zarunok, looking for his chains to return them to him. Rem suggested with the chains we might be able to retrieve the Sword of Karz. She says Zarunok has plans for him. Doesn't want any artifacts delivered to the Rexum. 
	- Perse asked why the gods are so hands off, she said the GD doesn't want them to take it back. Perse suggested it might be against the GD's will to return it to Zarunok. Rem asked if Zarunok would be willing to let us keep the chains if we used them against the Rexum to retrieve the Sword, asked Taryn to arrange a discussion. Taryn offered to take us to him. Can't tell us where in advance.
		- Valindra asked what would happen if we didn't return the chains - he will continue to try and take it. Taryn isn't the only servant of his looking for them. 
		- Perse asked if she could promise no harm could come to us, she said we'd have to be respectful. Couldn't exactly promise us.
			- Valindra asked if he might try to take the heart. Perhaps. Zarunok doesn't care about "elves being tainted", we're all just mortals to him.
	- We split the party, Lewis and Perse would stay behind, the rest would head with Taryn to talk to Zarunok. Valindra took off the heart of etifa, cold damage, gave it to Lewis who put it in the bag of holding.
- META: Zarunok conversation
	- Etheral, red stars, in space. Taryn introduced them. Zarunok asked for confirmation of our mission. Rem confirmed we are seeking the artifacts. 
		- Zarunok asked why. Rem said that's a question he's been asking himself. Said we were nominated by the factions of Dominion to retrieve the artifacts for the Rexum. Rem said he's sworn to serve the GD, wondering if that's the best way to do it. Z asked why we haven't taken it back yet. Rem asked to keep the chains to help retrieve the sword of Karz. Z asked if we mean to kill the Rexum.
			- Rem said he knows that the Rexum chooses not to do more about the plague. He deserves to be stripped of power. Z asked what happens after. Rem wants peace, prosperity, plenty, to help those inflicted by the plague.
		- Z said he's at an impasse. Says someone should take the Rexum's place. Asked if Rem thought himself worthy. Rem said he'd prob be terrible at it, but the bar is low. Z said he won't make the same mistake of choosing another champion, but does want to see the Rxm fall. Asks that if Rem uses the chains, make sure he has something in mind to replace the Rexum to avoid chaos. If he can do that, we'll have his blessing. Rem swore he'd pursue the best course of action that he can. 
			- Z said we have his blessing to make the decisions necessary. He asked that Ria and Valindra also have a plan after killing the Rexum to avoid chaos. 
		- Z said he'd grant us use of the chains. Retrieve them and use them to bring down the Rexum. Then he'll aid in the aftermath. If we're not up to replacing him, we'll find another solution. Rem agreed to it, shook his hand, and his hand burned. 
	- Z mentioned he wants Taryn to collect more info on someone else. 
		- Rem mentioned the LG, that is who Taryn will be looking into. Z said forget anything the LG said, this isn't their world, said the LG is an abomination that will be destroyed, don't listen to its lies. 
		- Ria stayed quiet, Valindra stepped up, asked about the LG's sister - Rem clarified the Apex Queen. Z got mad, repeated not to listen to any lies, there is no "other" (Apex Queen). Had Taryn take us away. 
- They returned to us
	- Taryn said beware the undead corruption as we proceeded to the city. Questioned if Valindra was being influenced by the LG. Warned that foul things seek us, be careful. 
- Camp
	- Rem filled us in on what happened with Z
		- He brought up the fact that we have the means to change Skediwen's future. He believes we don't serve anyone well by returning it to them. 
			- Ria doesn't give a shit about the Rexum
			- Lewis was shocked, asked Rem about it. Rem believes the Rexum could be doing more to help the people but chooses not to. Lewis agreed the Rexum only wanted the artifacts for himself. Rem said when he was a boy and Karz's sap was discovered to cure the plague, they immediately stopped administering it. 
		- Perse asked if we should start preparing for the rise of king Rem. Rem asked why him, mentioned Ria might be better. Ria said she doesn't see a future for herself. Said there are far better leaders than him. Perse said he'd potentially be the best option. He said he'd do what must be done. We could get the other factions to turn against the Rexum, minimize damage in the coup. 
			- She joked about it, said he was an interesting project, could write songs about him.
