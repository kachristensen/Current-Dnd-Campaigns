## Summary

## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> 

## Notes
- We killed the ruffians (assassins)? Black hooded uniforms. We investigated the bodies, their leader had orders to kill us by description, last known location (Maghaven) - suspected destination (town to the north), 500g per head, signed G. 
	- Corpse of Isolde here, killed with a slice to the neck. Was the Isolde we met earlier a fake? This one doesn't have anything we gave her. We buried her. Lewis cast Ceremony, funeral rites. 
- Perse suggested we skip Temult to avoid exposing them to danger, party discussed buying mounts in disguise.
	- Rem asked if Lewis had everything he needed for the cure, he said yes.
		- Perse asked if we should draw Rem's blood beforehand, he said we'd talk about it
- Later - Taryn appeared, walking towards us, smiled and waved. Seems like she was looking for us. She asked how our time in Maghaven was. I told her to get to the point.
	- She said she knows we're looking for things. She transformed into a huge devillish/angelic red-skinned woman, carrying a large golden scythe. Lewis admired her beautiful blade.
	- Rem said she seeks us out bc we seek her master's artifacts, she agreed. She wants our help in regaining an artifact. She's a servant of Zarunok, looking for his chains to return them to him. Rem suggested with the chains we might be able to retrieve the Sword of Karz. She says Zarunok has plans for him. Doesn't want any artifacts delivered to the Rexum. 
	- Perse asked why the gods are so hands off, she said the GD doesn't want them to take it back. Perse suggested it might be against the GD's will to return it to Zarunok. Rem asked if Zarunok would be willing to let us keep the chains if we used them against the Rexum to retrieve the Sword, asked Taryn to arrange a discussion. Taryn offered to take us to him. Can't tell us where in advance.
		- Valindra asked what would happen if we didn't return the chains - he will continue to try and take it. Taryn isn't the only servant of his looking for them. 
		- Perse asked if she could promise no harm could come to us, she said we'd have to be respectful. Couldn't exactly promise us.
			- Valindra asked if he might try to take the heart. Perhaps. Zarunok doesn't care about "elves being tainted", we're all just mortals to him.
	- We split the party, Lewis and Perse would stay behind, the rest would head with Taryn to talk to Zarunok. Valindra took off the heart of etifa, cold damage, gave it to Lewis who put it in the bag of holding.
- META: Zarunok conversation
	- Etheral, red stars, in space.
