## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> 

## Notes
- Ladies returned, dome back up, watch
	- Rem and Perse
		- Perse opened the tome, int save but passed, feeling of being drunk briefly. Pages empty. Rem got the lantern of revealing. His divine sense revealed it to be celestial, like a creature. Told it to reveal itself in celestial. Words wrote out "why should I?"
			- Rem said we freed it from its bindings. Does it know where it was kept before that. 
				- It hasn't been fully released from its bindings. Rem asked what it is -- it's something of great knowledge. Knows what we wish to learn. Though it's not to be trusted. 
				- Perse asked if it could lie, he said he's all of knowledge, truth and lies included.
			- Rem asked what it's purpose was. Does it serve a greater power. Response: technically yes. Purpose to hold the knowledge and secrets of this world. To keep the secrets of the grand divine. The grand divine created it.  Rem asked how to release it. Tome said we already have the tools we need, it's being bound by magic created by the GD itself. Needs a counterbalance. It knows too much. 
			- Tome knows the GD's true purpose. Tome said its knowledge could come with a cost. What is truth is in the eye of the beholder. Rem asked its name. **Hypithia**. Something created by the GD's magic, or an equivalent would work. Would require that one of the artifacts be destroyed. In return, it could give us a different item. If multiple items were used, could counteract the need to destroy them (5 needed total). 
				- Rem suggested we wait for the 5. Book asked if it told Rem it was a god, would that help? Rem was thoughtful. Book said it was one of 12 Divine - we know of 10 including Karz. Yaluska of the Mire is the other one. 
					- I asked why they aren't known. Yaluska is the 3rd born, she used magic to break away from the GD. Hypithia is the 4th, was sealed away due to its knowledge. I asked why. GD is complicated entity, Yaluska wanted free will. Opening it would piss off the GD.
					- Hypithia is the god of knowledge and secrets. Said to know too much was to be mad. I asked if she was mad, she said depends but kinda.
			- Perse handed Rem the tome, said she was curious but the tome was integral to Rem's beliefs/beings so he should hold it. 
				- If we close the book it goes dormant.
				- Perse asked if the int save would happen again, it said it was like it was yawning, shouldn't happen to the same degree again.
			- Perse asked about Xchimaltia (1st born) and Hades. A deal was made. Ink becoming harder to read. Zarunok. Servants. Book only knows so much. We let it rest and will check on it in a day or so.
