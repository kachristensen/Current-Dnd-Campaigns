## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> 

## Notes
- Ladies returned, dome back up, watch
	- Rem and Perse
		- Perse opened the tome, int save but passed, feeling of being drunk briefly. Pages empty. Rem got the lantern of revealing. His divine sense revealed it to be celestial, like a creature. Told it to reveal itself in celestial. Words wrote out "why should I?"
			- Rem said we freed it from its bindings. Does it know where it was kept before that. 
				- It hasn't been fully released from its bindings.
