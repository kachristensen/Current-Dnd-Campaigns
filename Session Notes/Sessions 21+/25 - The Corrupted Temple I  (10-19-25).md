## Summary
Porto extended Mastenovti's offer of assassinating someone for a powerful artifact. The party agreed to conduct a blood ritual with him at some point to learn more. They returned to St. Imelda's temple and began clearing it of numerous large insects.

## IC Synopsis - Ria
> Night watch held under observation by unknown creature(s)- later identified as the demon Porto. Tiny Hut believed to have provided sufficient cover. Valindra exited briefly during my shift with her, during which she approached our observer. Subject(s) of conversation unknown (spoken in Abyssal). 
   Final watch shift performed by Rembrandt and Valindra. Interrogation of Porto performed by Rembrandt regarding its master’s intentions in making a deal with the late Dr. Heisner. Porto refused to answer, inquiring if we would speak with the demon Mastenovti. It warned of danger in the temple. 
   Persephone approached Porto to converse the following morning. It claimed to have news and insinuated it had been observing us for an unknown amount of time. Its master had a trade to propose, now that it knew our purpose: kill someone for another artifact currently in possession of Mastenovti. Persephone pressed for specifics, to which Porto suggested ritually contacting Mastenovti (blood sacrifice required).  
   Porto refused to join the party at the temple, calling it tainted along with surrounding land and fauna. Lewis was able to concur due to a prophetic dream the previous night. Whatever this entity was, Lewis stated it was eager to lure him in. 
   Persephone approached Valindra to inquire about her mental state en route to the temple. Trauma surrounding chains/bondage/imprisonment noted, due to past treatment by the Viridian Scales cult. Of three elves mentioned as captives, one deceased (Solana), status of second (Ralnor) unknown by Valindra. No obstruction of function/capability noted. 
   Temple found to be infested with large insectoid creatures upon entry. Combat initiated immediately. Notable distress observed in party member Lewis during engagement- possible phobia of insects present. Minor casualties only, no deaths. 
   Proceeded further into the temple, down to a lower level. Giant spiders encountered, eliminated immediately. Side room contained two creatures (drider) with the upper body of a humanoid, fused with the body of a giant spider, accompanied by more arachnid creatures. Combat initiated, no casualties. 
   In the same side room, the party found more stairs leading into a subterranean tunnel and proceeded downward. Encountered more creatures with mixed arachnid/humanoid features. Combat initiated. 

## Notes
- Valindra/Ria watch
	- Valindra seemed uncomfortable/needed space, stepped out. 
		- META: Snuck up on Valindra, spoke in perfect Abyssal. Asked what Porto was doing here. He wants to speak with Perse and Valindra. Told Valindra he knows of a potential interesting item, might tell in due time. Valindra said she's just looking for a reprieve from her memories. Valindra said she wouldn't trust a demon, Porto said ironic for what she is. 
		- Porto warned us that this place was of great terror and evil, to be on guard.
	- Ria went to check where Valindra was, then went back inside.
	- Rem woke up
		- META: dream, same golden fields, but looming shadow behind him
		- Demanded Porto show himself, threatened him if he didn't. Rem talked about Mastenovti/Jonas, asked why would Mas agree to help him. Porto said it isn't his secret to tell. Porto offered to help with his tainted blood. 
	- Lewis dream META - he was in a temple, statue of St. Imelda. Said he was close, will see her soon. Was a fake, he saw through her. Temple decayed, voice deepened. Not the Living God. Xitalla? Looks forward to meeting him soon. 
- Valindra called out to me in the morning, was in at a tree with Porto. 
	- Porto said our activities have been observed. They know of incident in human city. Asked if we were here for items of power. I deflected. Said Mastenovti knows what we seek. Proposes a trade. Wants us to kill someone for item. Says details will be discussed in person, wants us to visit him in person, Porto can guide us. He suggested we conduct a ritual instead to speak directly, requires blood. I said if he tags along he'll find plenty of it. Porto asked what we were doing here, recommended we don't go to the temple, tainted. Land is corrupted, and their blood would be too. Said he could use our combined blood. 
		- Valindra asked if her blood was tainted, Porto said nah, pure.
		- Rem said he wouldn't give his blood.
		- Ria was fine with it. 
		- Porto suggested we sacrifice Wuffi for the blood. Wuffi got defensive.
		- I told Porto he could come with us and we'd find something else to kill, wild game or something. He said he'd wait for us outside the temple.
	- Lewis said he had a dream, told us something lies inside the temple. Eager to see him. We'll go cleanse it.
	- Porto said he'd wait here for 2 days.
	- Ria isn't wearing her shades today. Sclera are completely pitch blade. Bright yellow iris, slitted pupils.
- Otw to the temple
	- I complimented Ria, then talked to Validra, asked if she was ok. The chains gave her PTSD. She needed some fresh air. The day they took her, they clad her in irons. Three of her family were taken, a girl her age Solana, was killed before she left. Also an older man, Ralnor, they labored together, lost contact eventually. I comforted her.  
- Temple - we fought some giant centipedes
	- Mosaic on the floor - sun rays connecting to the gods
	- We proceeded inside, spiders, we fireballed. Sound of a door opening in the distance. 
	- Driders, flying spider, ettercaps, etc.
