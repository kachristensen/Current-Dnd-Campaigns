- Dreams
	- Lewis - awoke alone in Tiny Hut, trees are dead and bare - blood red sunset, tall figure 100ft away, arms outstretched. Lewis left the barrier, LG greeted him & warned him that we've attracted the attn of his sister. Not a lot of time to decide - accept the LG's offer or Xi'talla will have him instead. Pressured him to take his hand and swear the oath, running out of time. LG's face started leaking black fluid, in pain, fell to their knees, Lewis took their hand. LG's hand decomposed into maggots. Same creepy laughter from before. He woke up.
	- Ria - trance, smelled incense, in an empty gothic church. Someone praying, her sister. Ria summoned a bit of magic in her hand, approached. Sister told her not to come back. Ria asked in disbelief if that was the first thing she wanted to say to her in 15 years. Sister warned her there's nothing left for her at home. Ria said she knows, not returning for herself. 
		- Sister asked why return? Unfinished business, debts to pay. Sister asked if she was one of them -- no, she's not home. 
		- Ria asked where she is, sister can't tell. Missing both eyes, hornets crawling out. If she tells, it will bring Ria closer to "her" (Xi'talla?).
			- Insight check - this does seem like her real sister
		- Sister apologized to Ria. Ria asked how this happened. Sister said their mother isn't the only influential mother. Ria said the Orthodoxy should've protected her from this, how did she come into contact with Xi'talla? Sister can't tell her, still loves her, wants to protect her from seeing what she has. Don't come back.
			- Ria said she can't accept that request. Loud buzzing, swarming hornets. Promised her sister Maja (Maya) that she would free her. Woke up.
	- Rem - awoke in a cell, Jonas's basement. Jonas, bloodied, sitting on the dissection table, eating a pear. Asked how Rem was doing. Rem checked for his wounds, said times were trying. Jonas expressed his sympathy. 
		- Rem asked if he knows why we killed him, Jonas says yes, he doesn't blame us for it. Rem asked what Mastenovti wanted out of his deal. Jonas doesn't know. 
		- Rem pointed out even if the demonic cure worked, there had to have been a catch. Jonas hoped it would have been contained to himself, but the cure lives on inside of Rem. Jonas asked what he intends to do with it. Rem intends to get rid of the lycanthropy. Jonas said it could be the hope/cure of thousands.
		- Rem said he'd love to cure them, but his demonic lycanthropy isn't the answer. Jonas said Rem has now also tainted the cure with Karz's blood. Rem asked if he should just give his blood to the infected -- Jonas said maybe not yet, but give it a chance--don't seek a remedy for something that isn't an ailment.
		- Rem asked if Jonas has dreams of running every night. Jonas didn't, but dreams of ripping apart the people he loved the most. Rem said he doesn't have to dream for that part -- Jonas asked for elaboration, Rem said dwai.
		- Rem asked for more info about the lycanthropy, how to control it? Not much info - Jonas gave him a key under the bars, said Rem had a choice to do something great. Let himself out or stay in the cell. Rem said if not this cell, there'd be another. Jonas said it doesn't have to be that way. Don't let his work go to waste, be a hero. 
		- Jonas faded away. Rem picked up the key. Private DM 1:1! He looked down at it, then woke up.
	- Valindra - in a grotto, pool of water, nude figure emerged - Vera. Vera walked straight up to her and kissed her on the mouth. Acting marital.
		- Valindra was surprised, stepped back, asked where they were. Vera asked what she meant, does she feel ok? Valindra asked why she kissed her. Vera: why wouldn't I? Didn't you like it? Valindra says it's her first time, it was pleasant but surprising. Vera felt Valindra's forehead, asked if she was feeling well, said she was acting strange -- like they've never kissed before. Valindra was very confused.
		- Vera called her dear and told her they should eat dinner, led her by the hand to a campfire. Valindra doesn't have her weapon but is in her normal gear.
		- Vera brought a plate with a heart, smaller, human. It's Ria's. Vera said they need to finish the ritual. Valindra was panicked, said she has to protect her. Body of Ria lying behind them, big hole carved out. Vera said this was for Lord SJ. Valindra argued, said to keep her safe.
		- Lord SJ's voice - "I did tell you that, didn't I?" Safe for what? Valindra speechless, woke up.
- In the morning
	- Ria, Lewis, Valindra all woke up disturbed. Ria was pissed, lightning crackling. 
		- Lewis pulled out the bag of holding, found the hand of the LG.
		- Perse asked if they were well, asked what happened.
			- Lewis explained the LG visited him in his dreams, was like his power faded, he heard the heirophant laughing again. Says something needs to be done.
			- Ria agreed, said its master needs to die, vehement. It has her sister. Ria is going to find her. 
			- Valindra said Lord SJ spoke to her, first time. She was shaky and disturbed, staring at Ria. Said he told her to kill her. Ria said it was obvious, said he's been using her. Lord SJ wants its power/life back. Valindra didn't think Ria had to die for that, Ria questioned why. Valindra said she was shown something different at first. Perse asked what was her first vision - it showed Valindra who RIa was so that she could find her, Valindra protecting her.
				- Her second vision - Vera brought Ria's heart and told her to eat it. 
		- Perse steadied Ria with a hand. Asked about Rem, he also had a dream - told us about Jonas, embrace the lycanthropy to use it as a cure and combine it with his own blood. 
		- Perse asked Valindra if she'd still kill Ria, asked if she'd confide in her first if she changed her mind. Valindra said she still wants to protect her. 
		- Lewis said the bug goddess seems like she's recruiting, Ria suspects infiltration into the orthodoxy, where her sister was sent. Maja Drakesbane.
		- We speculated why it happened to all of them at once - prob related to deeper understanding of Xi'talla who attacks the mind.
	- Lewis and Rem went off to pray
		- Lewis said it was for a morning activity. Said he needs answers, this is the only way he knows how. Why would a priest turn against St. Imelda? He pulled out the decapitated head, rotting brain matter, said he's surprised Ria isn't stopping him. Rem offered to tell him the answer if he didn't eat it. Lewis: if he believes him, yes.
			- Rem said they both know what that cult is worshipping - to know that entity is to harbor corruption. Whatever corrupted the priestess, it wasn't who she once was. She was forced into it. Lewis disagreed. Rem said by entertaining these thoughts, Lewis is letting the corruption win. Said he can come back and reconsecrate it, but don't lower himself to this. 
			- Lewis was convinced and stopped. Agreed he could come back and hallow this place again. Lewis tried to bury the head, had to make an int save, succeeded. They shared a moment, Rem has his back. 
	- Girl convo - Ria seems like she's compartmentalizing. Perse grabbed both her and Ria by the shoulders, wrapped her arms around them, tried to comfort them, told them to take a deep breath. Valindra doesn't want to hurt her. Ria said Lord SJ will want vengeance. Perse asked Valindra what she would want to do if no one told her anything. She said she ran away the last time she wanted to do something, to be free. Perse asked why. She just watched her friend died, she held Solana as she died and didn't want that anymore. She doesn't want to have the pain anymore. Wants purpose.
		- Perse asked purpose to fill the hole left behind? That and she wanted more from life. Thought she had found it with lord SJ, but not sure if it's right anymore. Ria says she has no intentions of helping. They're both pawns of lord SJ. 
		- I gently encouraged Valindra to live for herself, find out what she likes to do. Valindra likes to help people, wants to help Ria to atone for what she's done. She's good at killing people. They have an accord.
		- Perse kissed Ria and Valindra on the cheek and let them go. Valindra asked what a kiss on the lips with a girl meant. I said it was romantic, we'd discuss this more along the road. 
- Porto - Perse told him we'd be taking the long way around, said we'd see him in a month. Porto was created for Mastanovti, doesn't remember his previous life. Perse told him if he requires work she'd happily hire him. 
	- Lewis and Perse discussed - Lewis told me he can cast Sending to Porto at any time. She asked if he could send a message to Ophani to ask more about the state of the Orthodoxy.
- Travelling north
	- Later in the day -- tall woman, Perse called out and greeted her. She crossed a line in the path. Seems quirky.
		- She says she's seen corpse moths before, a long time ago.
