- Dreams
	- Lewis - awoke alone in Tiny Hut, trees are dead and bare - blood red sunset, tall figure 100ft away, arms outstretched. Lewis left the barrier, LG greeted him & warned him that we've attracted the attn of his sister. Not a lot of time to decide - accept the LG's offer or Xi'talla will have him instead. Pressured him to take his hand and swear the oath, running out of time. LG's face started leaking black fluid, in pain, fell to their knees, Lewis took their hand. LG's hand decomposed into maggots. Same creepy laughter from before. He woke up.
	- Ria - trance, smelled incense, in an empty gothic church. Someone praying, her sister. Ria summoned a bit of magic in her hand, approached. Sister told her not to come back. Ria asked in disbelief if that was the first thing she wanted to say to her in 15 years. Sister warned her there's nothing left for her at home. Ria said she knows, not returning for herself. 
		- Sister asked why return? Unfinished business, debts to pay. Sister asked if she was one of them -- no, she's not home. 
		- Ria asked where she is, sister can't tell. Missing both eyes, hornets crawling out. If she tells, it will bring Ria closer to "her" (Xi'talla?).
			- Insight check - this does seem like her real sister
		- Sister apologized to Ria. Ria asked how this happened. Sister said their mother isn't the only influential mother. Ria said the Orthodoxy should've protected her from this, how did she come into contact with Xi'talla? Sister can't tell her, still loves her, wants to protect her from seeing what she has. Don't come back.
			- Ria said she can't accept that request. Loud buzzing, swarming hornets. Promised her sister Maya that she would free her. Woke up.
	- Rem - awoke in a cell, Jonas's basement.
