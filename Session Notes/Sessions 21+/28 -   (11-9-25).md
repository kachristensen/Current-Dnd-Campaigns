- Dreams
	- Lewis - awoke alone in Tiny Hut, trees are dead and bare - blood red sunset, tall figure 100ft away, arms outstretched. Lewis left the barrier, LG greeted him & warned him that we've attracted the attn of his sister. Not a lot of time to decide - accept the LG's offer or Xi'talla will have him instead. Pressured him to take his hand and swear the oath, running out of time. LG's face started leaking black fluid, in pain, fell to their knees, Lewis took their hand. LG's hand decomposed into maggots. Same creepy laughter from before. He woke up.
	- Ria - trance, smelled incense, in an empty gothic church. Someone praying, her sister. Ria summoned a bit of magic in her hand, approached. Sister told her not to come back. Ria asked in disbelief if that was the first thing she wanted to say to her in 15 years. Sister warned her there's nothing left for her at home. Ria said she knows, not returning for herself. 
		- Sister asked why return? Unfinished business, debts to pay. Sister asked if she was one of them -- no, she's not home. 
		- Ria asked where she is, sister can't tell. Missing both eyes, hornets crawling out. If she tells, it will bring Ria closer to "her" (Xi'talla?).
			- Insight check - this does seem like her real sister
		- Sister apologized to Ria. Ria asked how this happened. Sister said their mother isn't the only influential mother. Ria said the Orthodoxy should've protected her from this, how did she come into contact with Xi'talla? Sister can't tell her, still loves her, wants to protect her from seeing what she has. Don't come back.
			- Ria said she can't accept that request. Loud buzzing, swarming hornets. Promised her sister Maja (Maya) that she would free her. Woke up.
	- Rem - awoke in a cell, Jonas's basement. Jonas, bloodied, sitting on the dissection table, eating a pear. Asked how Rem was doing. Rem checked for his wounds, said times were trying. Jonas expressed his sympathy. 
		- Rem asked if he knows why we killed him, Jonas says yes, he doesn't blame us for it. Rem asked what Mastenovti wanted out of his deal. Jonas doesn't know. 
		- Rem pointed out even if the demonic cure worked, there had to have been a catch. Jonas hoped it would have been contained to himself, but the cure lives on inside of Rem. Jonas asked what he intends to do with it. Rem intends to get rid of the lycanthropy. Jonas said it could be the hope/cure of thousands.
		- Rem said he'd love to cure them, but his demonic lycanthropy isn't the answer. Jonas said Rem has now also tainted the cure with Karz's blood. Rem asked if he should just give his blood to the infected -- Jonas said maybe not yet, but give it a chance--don't seek a remedy for something that isn't an ailment.
		- Rem asked if Jonas has dreams of running every night. Jonas didn't, but dreams of ripping apart the people he loved the most. Rem said he doesn't have to dream for that part -- Jonas asked for elaboration, Rem said dwai.
		- Rem asked for more info about the lycanthropy, how to control it? Not much info - Jonas gave him a key under the bars, said Rem had a choice to do something great. Let himself out or stay in the cell. Rem said if not this cell, there'd be another. Jonas said it doesn't have to be that way. Don't let his work go to waste, be a hero. 
		- Jonas faded away. Rem picked up the key. Private DM 1:1! He looked down at it, then woke up.
	- Valindra -
