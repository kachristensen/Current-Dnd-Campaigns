- Dreams
	- Lewis - awoke alone in Tiny Hut, trees are dead and bare - blood red sunset, tall figure 100ft away, arms outstretched. Lewis left the barrier, LG greeted him & warned him that we've attracted the attn of his sister. Not a lot of time to decide - accept the LG's offer or Xi'talla will have him instead. Pressured him to take his hand and swear the oath, running out of time. LG's face started leaking black fluid, in pain, fell to their knees, Lewis took their hand. LG's hand decomposed into maggots. Same creepy laughter from before. He woke up.
	- Ria - trance, smelled incense, in an empty gothic church. Someone praying, her sister.
