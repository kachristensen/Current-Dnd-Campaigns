## Notes
- Valindra/Ria watch
	- Valindra seemed uncomfortable/needed space, stepped out. 
		- META: Snuck up on Valindra, spoke in perfect Abyssal. Asked what Porto was doing here. He wants to speak with Perse and Valindra. Told Valindra he knows of a potential interesting item, might tell in due time. Valindra said she's just looking for a reprieve from her memories. Valindra said she wouldn't trust a demon, Porto said ironic for what she is. 
		- Porto warned us that this place was of great terror and evil, to be on guard.
	- Ria went to check where Valindra was, then went back inside.
	- Rem woke up
		- META: dream, same golden fields, but looming shadow behind him
		- Demanded Porto show himself, threatened him if he didn't. Rem talked about Mastenovti/Jonas, asked why would Mas agree to help him. Porto said it isn't his secret to tell. Porto offered to help with his tainted blood. 
	- Lewis dream META - he was in a temple, statue of St. Imelda. Said he was close, will see her soon. Was a fake, he saw through her. Temple decayed, voice deepened. Not the Living God. Xitalla? Looks forward to meeting him soon. 
- Valindra called out to me in the morning, was in at a tree with Porto.
