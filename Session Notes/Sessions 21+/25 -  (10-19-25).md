## Notes
- Valindra/Ria watch
	- Valindra seemed uncomfortable/needed space, stepped out. 
		- META: Snuck up on Valindra, spoke in perfect Abyssal. Asked what Porto was doing here. He wants to speak with Perse and Valindra. Told Valindra he knows of a potential interesting item, might tell in due time. Valindra said she's just looking for a reprieve from her memories. Valindra said she wouldn't trust a demon, Porto said ironic for what she is. 
		- Porto warned us that this place was of great terror and evil, to be on guard.
