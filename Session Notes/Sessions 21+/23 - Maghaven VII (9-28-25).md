## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Valindra
>Lady Sabine was quite receptive to our killing of the dragon that plagued these lands. It… is a strange feeling. It felt, dirty, trying to present myself to it as a new follower. I thought it would be willing to talk or at least show itself to us. It only saw me as food. I lied about my faith for the deception, for it all to amount for nothing. This creature only saw me and my friends as food. Was this what Perse’s song was really about?
  These thoughts plague me as we wait for our meeting the Agnes. The others seem content to spend our gold. I do worry at times that they are on the verge of greed. They always seem to want for more. I feel blessed to have all that I have now, it is so much more than I have ever had. Let alone all this gold. I am truly grateful, that Lewis is so competent with his tools.  This glaive and I have been partnered for some time now, and it feels so natural to use.
  Oh. Speaking of Lewis, he is looking to speak to Ria. He of all people would be safe to not harm her… STOP VALINDRA. Persephone told you to stop.
  Perhaps listing in to their conversation will distract. Oh, he is giving her a cloak. Those colors for sure fit her well, Lewis has a good eye. Though… what is he saying? It, it just is hurting me to watch him fumble through his words. As if he never spoke with Ria before. She seems to think he is courting? Oh, Lewis is trying to say otherwise. I am very lost at this, and why do I feel a strange feeling in my stomach? Persephone calls it second hand embarrassment. This is a new feeling. Ria did seem to respond to the gift. Persephone was quick to remind me to not try such things first. 
  Afterwards, Rem and I head outside to sadly Annica and Wuffi with their new saddles. Wuffi seems to stand a bit taller with it. He seems to really like it. Perhaps a gift for Wuffi more often might be nice for him. He seems to like getting things.
  Back inside Rem was swinging his new blade and shield getting a feel for it. Lewis called me over to help prep for our encounter. His magic always washes over so calming on us. The invigoration to have such allies does make it feel like I can do anything. Lewis leave Rem and I to address Persephone. I want to find time to talk to her. She was so shaken by that dragon. I know she said it was not my fault. But I know better than to position my allies in a bad spot. I wish Persephone would understand my mistakes and punish me as I should be instead of letting these mistakes go…
  Lewis offers up Persephone some of his divine words. They are soothing to hear and I can tell Persephone is taken aback in a small way. He lays his hands on her and blesses her with his magic. This one is new. I have never seen Lewis provide such a blessing on someone. I wonder what boon it provides her?
  Shortly later, we find ourselves at Agnes’ workshop. Rem was quick to get to the point with her. Telling her we are after the bracer. As that question, or rather demand, hung in the air, I noticed her factory empty. Save for a number of her creations. Her reply to Rem came with a command to said automatons. They whirled to life, set on us. Their blades coming fast, the numbers are against us. Ria quickly is surrounded by them. Even with her powerful lightning that machine press on. I tried to replicate said lightning with my javelin, paling in comparison to her strength. But they saw her threat and injured her greatly. I wanted to run over and protect her. Persephone was quicker turning Ria into a giant ape.
Rem has killed Agnes on the other side of the workshop, though with her death she warns of what consequences. Rem quick removed her arm with the bracer to turn back to aid us. As some of the blade dolls begin to fall, the Nanny gets closer and more menacing. It already brought Wuffi down with ease, turning its gaze to me. Beneath its dress it launched chains at me. I was too slow to avoid them and they clamped onto both one arm and around the neck.

That steel on my skin. It feels so familiar. In a panic I try to break out but it has my tight. The memories obscure my vision, and the workshop is no more. All I see is the forest of my childhood. My feet bloody from walking bare on the ground. My mouth parched at the lack of drink. Looking down I see the yoke on my neck again.  The one clasp around me when I was taken. That steel was cold, unforgiving. The one around my neck now if far warmer. 

I hear the large footfalls of a bigger creature in the back. It lumbers in, reverberating the floor with each step. It speaks finally breaking the memory I was caught in. It was Agnes’ voice in this cold machine. Enough. 

That survival instinct that I found 10 years ago resurfaces. With it, I summon my strength breaking the chains from my neck and arm. Getting away from the Nanny I follow Rem to the Agnes machine. I trust Persephone and Ria to finish the dammed thing. I hate those chains. I hate them. 
Sajj’aka is destined to protect us. Rem told me to question things. So why did The Scales chain me? Why are those set to bring back my protector hurting me? Am I on the wrong path?

I look at this iron creature as these thoughts distract me, only to settle on one last thought. This person put me in chains again, and right now, she needs to be stopped.
