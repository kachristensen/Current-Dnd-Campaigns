	- Message returned from Lucious Grubb - said if we needed anything, let him know, he'll be waiting in the clocktower. 
	- Lewis gifted Ria a cloak of billowing, Lewis got flustered when she said it wasn't time for courtship. Also presented her with the ring of Jumping. She put them back in her bag. Lewis was stammering extremely, was worried he got on her bad side.
	- Lewis came by, said he was here for me, he opened his book, dramatically said he wouldn't let me die again, wouldn't let me die again, cast Death Ward on me. I have become his family. Asked to hear my story when I was ready.
		- I pulled him aside to give him a hug, said I'd take some time to think.
- Agnes's workshop
	- Rem showed her the heart, said we want the bracer. She asked why. She's not willing to part with it. Rem said he was sworn to serve the divines and will take back what is there.
		- He beelined for Agnes and killed her, grabbed the bracer, inner lining punctured with dozens of needles like an iron maiden.
		- I polymorphed Ria 
		- Nanny/constructs can't be compelled magically to act against their programming
