###### Day 24
## Summary
The party killed their ambushers and parleyed with Lord Whalmer leading more cultists of the Devourer, then slew him as well.

## IC Synopsis - Ria
> This night was a tax of patience as much as resources. While we were able to finish off our attackers with little trouble, and largely evaded the attention of the sanatorium’s security constructs, the encounter was not the last. 
   Persephone at least was able to evacuate Ailbhe to the building’s exterior, instructing her to shelter in the barn with Rhenka and Annica. A relief to the others, I imagine, and one less thing to be concerned about in the moment— not that this stopped Rhenka from attempting to attack the building, for some reason. It’s not as though the attempt did anything but leave her wounded when the structure struck back. (See below notes.)
   We had a moment to regroup after the skirmish, during which we elected to remain and investigate the goings on at the sanatorium further. While we retreated and barricaded one of the bedrooms, Wuffi wandered alone down a set of stairs we discovered in the passages in the walls. At the bottom he was promptly killed.
   Shortly after, our respite was interrupted by Welmer’s voice. He spoke of a rejected “invitation”, stating he had not intended to kill us, and requested we join him in the basement to “hear him out”. When we apparently took too long for the old fool’s liking, he sent his doorman Tori up to parley with us. 
   In the subsequent conversation, we were told Welmer had been entertaining “unusual guests” in recent years, and in that same period had had a change of faith. Supposedly, Tori and Prudence were kept here to continue the upkeep of the sanatorium under threat of death. Likewise, he claimed they had been forced to participate in the profane rituals let by Welmer and his guests. Unsurprisingly, Lewis in particular was able to sense they were far from innocent victims here. 
   Tori is lucky he still had useful information to supply. He went on to tell us Welmer was quite taken with Rembrandt and Lewis in particular, and confirmed that the sanatorium had taken on some sort of life in the wake of the “feasting” held in its basement.
   After we learned all we might from Tori, Rembrandt knocked him out, and we determined we would attempt to speak further with Welmer, if only to gather more information before eradicating this latest cult cell. Persephone protested, but only on the grounds that we would wind up surrounded (a correct assumption), and gave little resistance in the face of a majority vote. 
   We concluded our rest, Valindra recalled Wuffi, and we proceeded down the stairs in the hidden passage. At the bottom we found a great ravine filled with bones, humanoid and animal alike. One cultist waited for us around the corner, and led us to where Welmer was waiting in what he referred to as the kitchen. 
   From there we proceeded to a disgusting excuse for a dining hall, and were made to wait there. Welmer arrived shortly with a request to join him for “a late night snack” lest we be made part of the ritual. He claimed to feel abandoned by the gods, particularly in the wake of the Secomortis Plague, and was convinced he was giving the world a future by having its sins devoured and thereby purified. 
   By all counts, the man was an idiot. For all his posturing and conviction, the only thing he had to show for this “purification” was a stinking pile of shit and rot.
   Given the option by to repent or die, Welmer chose death. Fittingly, having been the one to issue the ultimatum, Rembrandt dealt him the final blow. The rest of the cult, and the monsters under their command, similarly met their ends at our hands. I can only hope soon we can get a proper rest. Lewis in particular is in a bad way, and I am running low on resources myself. 
   But first, the matter of the living sanatorium remains. With the cult slain, the building shakes.

## Notes
- I fey stepped Ailbhe outside to the ground, told her to go find Rhenka and Annica, wait four us.
	- After fight - Rem telepathically talked to Annica, told her to keep Ailbhe close and hunker down. 
		- Rhenka attacked the house and it crit her, she returned back to the barn bleeding profusely.
	- Valindra sent Wuffi down the stairs while we were prayer of healing, I minor illusioned at the top. Wuffi was attacked downstairs. Cultist of the Devourer. Bones littered.
	- We went back to the room to rest and barred the doors. 5 min later, we heard Lord Whalmer speaking over intercoms, he doesn't want to kill us but hear them out. Invited us downstairs to the basement. 
	- 10 min - we prayer of healinged. 
	- Someone knocked at the wardrobe. Tori. Lord Whalmer sent him to parley. He's alone and wants to talk. I asked him what his part in all this is. In recent years he's been entertaining unusual guests, 4-5 years ago he changed faith, ultimatum - Tori and Prudence would continue to run this place or be killed. Worships a being of hunger. I asked if they were forced to be here, he said somewhat, but they have participated in these rituals. He didn't want to do any of it of his own volition. Some truth to what he's saying but he doesn't seem innocent in all this and is walking the line of trying to survive. 
		- Perse asked if he's been helping his master lure people here to eat them. Yes, he has, or else he'll be eaten too.
		- His master doesn't wish to consume us all unless he has to. Work with him or be eaten. There are at least 4 more ppl down there, mouth things, cultists.
		- Perse asked if the house is alive. He sweated and said yes. It wasn't always but the feasting that happens here is what gives ability to the hunger to manifest. This house has become a living creature. 
		- Tori said he was going to pretend to be knocked out, Rem actually knocked him out.
		- Rem wants to talk to Lord Whalmer, kept suggesting he go alone. I got a flask of holy water from Lewis
- We were led through basement tunnels, the kitchen, smelled of death, corpses, all people eating something. They were also eating undead.
	- Lord Whalmer - said he wanted to be precautious so he tried to capture us. We all seemed competent. He sees within Lewis and Rembrandt a younger himself. He invited us to a snack. Rem said nah. Our options are eat or be eaten. 
		- Rem said repent or be killed. Lord Whalmer said the gods turned their back on us. All of this is to devour the sins of this world, and have a purified world afterwards. He has secomortis too.
