## Notes
- Servant - **Prudence**, brought dinner. Also another servant, **Tori**.
	- Lord Whalmer asked what we were doing, Rem said we had liberated some slaves and were escorting them north, said we also had business in Valdrheim and asked what he knew.
		- He said it was a curse upon the city. Historically only in the city bounds, but now expanding. Also undead problem in Temut. Creatures are more intelligent and organized.
		- Rem and Lewis said grace. Lewis mentioned St. Imelda, Whalmer glanced away at it.
		- We discussed routes north, recommended the town of Kula to stop by. Most undead don't cross the river.
		- Saw a dragon made of bone and fire flying about. 
	- He went to bed, I cast invis and trailed him. Checked out the mansion. Locked door behind the stairs.
		- I tried to pick the door. 22 - not enough to open it. 2 armored creatures animated when I triggered the door, went to go stand in front of it. Prudence told them to go back to where they were standing and they obeyed. Lewis mentioned he was interested and inspected them. Prudence said Lord Whalmer 
	- Rem went outside to try and tend to his horse, front door was locked, front doorman Tori seemed nervous and had to unlock
- We went upstairs
	- I cast Leomund's Tiny Hut - told them about the door. Rem encouraged me to drop it.
	- Rem told us about what he learned from Hypithia - about the fruit, curing the plague by ascending, the Rexum wanting it. I asked if we were making him a god, he said we could find others more suited. If he falls, he wants one of us to do it in his stead. Lewis suggested me since I'm the closest to it. 
		- Rem suggested we start reaching out to our allies and mention them to try and start a rebellion. We discussed reaching back out to Lucius/Brumer, etc. 
		- Ria suggested we continue to look for a cure elsewhere but Perse didn't think it would bear anything.
