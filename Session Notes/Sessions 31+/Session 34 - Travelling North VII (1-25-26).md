## Notes
- Servant - **Prudence**, brought dinner. Also another servant, **Tori**.
	- Lord Whalmer asked what we were doing, Rem said we had liberated some slaves and were escorting them north, said we also had business in Valdrheim and asked what he knew.
		- He said it was a curse upon the city. Historically only in the city bounds, but now expanding. Also undead problem in Temut. Creatures are more intelligent and organized.
		- Rem and Lewis said grace. Lewis mentioned St. Imelda, Whalmer glanced away at it.
		- We discussed routes north, recommended the town of Kula to stop by. Most undead don't cross the river.
		- Saw a dragon made of bone and fire flying about. 
	- He went to bed, I cast invis and trailed him. Checked out the mansion. Locked door behind the stairs.
		- I tried to pick the door. 22 - not enough to open it. 2 armored creatures animated when I triggered the door, went to go stand in front of it. Prudence told them to go back to where they were standing and they obeyed. Lewis mentioned he was interested and inspected them. Prudence said Lord Whalmer 
	- Rem went outside to try and tend to his horse, front door was locked, front doorman Tori seemed nervous and had to unlock
- We went upstairs
	- I cast Leomund's Tiny Hut - told them about the door. Rem encouraged me to drop it.
	- Rem told us about what he learned from Hypithia - about the fruit, curing the plague by ascending, the Rexum wanting it. I asked if we were making him a god, he said we could find others more suited. If he falls, he wants one of us to do it in his stead. Lewis suggested me since I'm the closest to it. 
		- Rem suggested we start reaching out to our allies and mention them to try and start a rebellion. We discussed reaching back out to Lucius/Brumer, etc. 
		- Ria suggested we continue to look for a cure elsewhere but Perse didn't think it would bear anything. 
		- Perse asked to borrow Hypithia soon. Lewis asked to confirm that Remove Curse is the only way to cure the plague. She was annoyed at Rem for not prioritizing her questions. Rem gave her the book - Hypithia requires at least a day to recharge.
	- Ria cast detect magic - rug is magic, statues, and door (Abjuration).
	- Ria asked the servant about the cellar in the back, it used to be the morgue. Storage now. She said they don't understand how the undead plague works just in case there's undead spawning down there. Catacombs. Ria came and told me. 
	- I asked Ria about asking Hyphithia about her sister, she doesn't want to know where, knowledge is a dangerous infection. Said she's probably at her home. I asked if she was interested in asking about lord SJ, she said maybe. I asked if she wanted to know how to help her sister, maybe. I was sympathetic.
	- META: Ria had a dream. Creepy. In a desert, grey ashen sand, barren charred trees. Hooded figure in black. "Hello child." Wants her. Said it was a philanthropist here to help. It senses pain in Ria. Wants to guide her towards the right way. Ria was cold and standoffish.
		- This universe runs on indifference - doesn't punish cruelty or correct injustice, just is. Offered her a release from pain. Ria called her a manipulator. 
		- Her family isn't unique, just features of this ecosystem. Wanted to know what Ria's goals were, what if they wanted the same thing. Destruction. Why should existence exist? Ria said only her own aims matter. But Xi'talla put herself in her path. Ria has no interest in working with her, wants to destroy her. 
		- Figure took off her hood. Humanoid, white skin, red eyes, insectlike appendages on the head. Said she isn't who Ria thinks she is - she's a harbinger of "Sleeping Mother", Xi'talla. Offered Ria to join her. Ria cone of lightning'd her.
