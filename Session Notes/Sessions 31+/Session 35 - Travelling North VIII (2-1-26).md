## Notes
- I fey stepped Ailbhe outside to the ground, told her to go find Rhenka and Annica, wait four us.
	- After fight - Rem telepathically talked to Annica, told her to keep Ailbhe close and hunker down. 
		- Rhenka attacked the house and it crit her, she returned back to the barn bleeding profusely.
	- Valindra sent Wuffi down the stairs while we were prayer of healing, I minor illusioned at the top. Wuffi was attacked downstairs. Cultist of the Devourer. Bones littered.
	- We went back to the room to rest and barred the doors. 5 min later, we heard Lord Whalmer speaking over intercoms, he doesn't want to kill us but hear them out. Invited us downstairs to the basement. 
	- 10 min - we prayer of healinged. 
	- Someone knocked at the wardrobe. Tori. Lord Whalmer sent him to parley. He's alone and wants to talk. I asked him what his part in all this is. In recent years he's been entertaining unusual guests, 4-5 years ago he changed faith, ultimatum - Tori and Prudence would continue to run this place or be killed. Worships a being of hunger. I asked if they were forced to be here, he said somewhat, but they have participated in these rituals. He didn't want to do any of it of his own volition. Some truth to what he's saying but he doesn't seem innocent in all this and is walking the line of trying to survive. 
		- Perse asked if he's been helping his master lure people here to eat them. Yes, he has, or else he'll be eaten too.
		- His master doesn't wish to consume us all unless he has to. Work with him or be eaten. There are at least 4 more ppl down there, mouth things, cultists.
		- Perse asked if the house is alive. He sweated and said yes. It wasn't always but the feasting that happens here is what gives ability to the hunger to manifest. This house has become a living creature. 
		- Tori said he was going to pretend to be knocked out, Rem actually knocked him out.
		- Rem wants to talk to Lord Whalmer, kept suggesting he go alone. I got a flask of holy water from Lewis
- We were led through basement tunnels, the kitchen, smelled of death, corpses, all people eating something.
