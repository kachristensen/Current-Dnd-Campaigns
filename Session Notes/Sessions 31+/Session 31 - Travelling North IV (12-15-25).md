## IC Synopsis - As Rememberede by Rembrandt
> With our wounds tended to, we searched the bodies of the fallen undead.  Ria found a Scroll of Create Undead on the skeletal knight, but noted the rest of the forces bore older, dilapidated arms and armor.  She surmised that the skeletal knight had used such a scroll to raise the others, but there was no indication as to who the skeletal knight served in turn.  Ria handed the scroll over to Perse, who suggested Lewis use his Mace of Disruption to destroy the undead bodies.  He obliged her request, but not before he took possession of the skeletal knight’s armor and used his own to cast Speak with Dead.  The knight revealed his name was Roderick, but disclosed little else.  I resummoned Anicca and fit her saddle as the others tended to their business.
   We drew closer to Temut and Valindra offered to scout ahead.  Lewis and I remained hidden in the woods, while Ria and Perse joined Valindra under the guise of Pass Without Trace.  The trio approached a small farmstead and overheard some idle chatter.  After climbing on a roof for a better vantage point, Ria used Invisibility so they could infiltrate even further.  She noted at least eight mercenaries occupied the area, wearing sun insignias.  Perse approached the cages they were protecting and peeked beneath the tarps to determine what they held.  Inside, she found two of the ashen folk we’d seen in Barca, an elf woman, and an ugly, ornery creature Valindra called a Redcap.  The largest of the cages was occupied by a musky-smelling creature, but it was closely guarded and Perse was unable to see inside it.
   While we waited, I checked on Lewis.  Despite the disdain he was facing, he remained in good spirits.  He claimed to understand why Ria was upset with him, but seemed more perplexed as to what had drawn Perse’s ire.  The woman’s capriciousness cannot be comprehended, but I suggested it was related to his actions towards Ria.  Hard to say how much she heard, but the woman in question smacked Lewis with the scroll Ria found before depositing it in his bag.  Invisibly of course, before they finally revealed themselves and recounted what they’d learned.
   Lewis knew of the mercenaries, and told us they were slavers called the Setting Sun.  After some deliberation, I declared my intention to openly approach and speak to these men.  Lewis joined me upon Anicca, while Valindra followed nearby invisibly.  Ria and Perse climbed onto the same roof as before, remaining hidden.  One of the mercenaries shouted to me as I rode forth and a short conversation followed.  He welcomed me as a Cathar, thinking I had come to deal with the undead plaguing Temut.  He believed they came from Valdrheim, and mentioned Countess Tessarae Harker was organizing nightly militias to dispatch them.  The Setting Sun worked for Lord Antoine and only dealt with the undead that wandered too close.  Their priority was protecting their captives until the auction that was scheduled for the following morning.  The mercenary also mentioned a local lord named Dareth being heavily involved in the slave trade.  I bristled at such brazen barbarism, but kept my composure.  I loudly remarked upon the “stormy weather” to Lewis, which cued Ria to reach out magically.  She held no love for these slavers, but pointed out that dealing with them would lead to retaliation from the local authorities, given their noble benefactors.
   Ria was right of course, but still the choice seemed clear.  Perse was the first to act, shrouding herself in a cloud of insects before teleporting onto the cages and obscuring everything within thirty feet.  The rest of us used the ensuing confusion to strike at the mercenaries, who in turn blew their horns and sounded the alarm.  Lewis surrounded himself with Spirit Guardians and lingered nearby Persephone as she magically commanded most of the mercenaries to approach her.  An effective combination that kept them contained, blinded, and burning.  Ria lingered on the periphery of the cloud and unleashed her lightning, doing her best to minimize the collateral damage.  I found myself in an almost comical ruse between two of our enemies, as we slashed at each other in the chaos.  Then, a teenage frost giant woman appeared beside me, having been freed by Perse from her cage.  I tossed her one of my javelins and provided some healing, though she struggled to use the weapon effectively.  Valindra pursued two men as they attempted to flee, killing one and knocking the other out at my suggestion.  I rendered the remaining two unconscious after they surrendered and turned over their keys.
   The battle was won, but the urgency had not abated.  Four prisoners remained caged as I turned towards Temut to gauge the response to the alarm…
