## Notes
- We freed the prisoners and killed the redcap. Perse killed the remaining mercenaries
	- Giant woman started beating the wall, Rem tried to tell her to stop and we'd make her one.
- Foreign fighters A & B. Elf - Ailbhe (pronounced Alva), doesn't speak common well, sticks to Valindra. Giantess - Rhenka
	- A & B thanked us and left. Lewis gave them a Scimitar, they recognized it as being from Barca, we have the LG's blessing. They offered Lewis hugs and called him friend. They gave us all hugs, Ria didn't let them. 
	- Alva is from the west, near Aosmhor Forest. She's been captured for a long time, 8 months
	- Rhenka is from the north, captured only for 7 days, offered to take us to her tribe for thanks
		- Rem asked if they know of Valdrhiem, asked if her people could help us
		- She's been captured for a long time
- We set up camp - tiny hut
	- Rhenka asked for a greataxe, Lewis crafted her one. Her presence drops the temp by 20
	- Perse asked about Rhenka's tribe - **Farbauta** (named after her father). They are strong but more smaller folk + undead incursions. Lots of chaos at home. Their tribe is 8 total giants. There are many tribes of giants in the north. Some hotter and uglier. I asked what their tribe does - they mostly try to survive and live in peace, stay out of trouble with the smallfolk. Says the snow elves aren't as friendly up north.
	- Ailbhe referred to the snow elves as the wild ones, they're very different from her kind. She isn't a fighter, wanted to come with us. We suggested we come with us to the frost giant tribe
