###### Day 24
## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> 


## Notes
- Valindra gave Ailbhe a bow. Aibhe will probably need a wizard to best learn magic.
- Short rest
	- META: Rem asked Hyphithia about any cures for the secomortis plague.
		- She said it was a blight thrust upon the mortals for slaying Karz, a manifestation of his pain and loss but a symbol of his resurrection. The cure isn't for all, but one. Because no knowledge of a cure exists, she doesn't know what it is. 
		- He asked if Jonas's "cure" was possible, she said it was more of putting the condition into remission.
		- The cause is the remains of Karz. The sap is the life essence being sucked out of those afflicted with the secomortis plague, so it can also provide relief. 
		- The plague shall remain in this world as a reminder of what happens when those who oppose the gods succeed. But the tree is a vessel in which all this life energy is being connected - possible for rebirth of Karz, or ascension of something else.
		- Only the one who created the plague can truly eradicate it. Once the fruit finally matures and is consumed, that is when the rebirth will happen. Will happen within 6 months. Those in power have been biding their time. Whoever consumes the fruit can cure the plague.
- Later - gully/small canyon. Temp dropped, feeling of dread. We killed a shadowghast. Some shadowy being called out "drained them of their life" and hovered up to the top.
	- Ria cast fly on Annica, we flew up. We saw a human rider also riding in our direction.
