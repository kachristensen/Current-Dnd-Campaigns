###### Day 24
## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> 


## Notes
- Valindra gave Ailbhe a bow. Aibhe will probably need a wizard to best learn magic.
- Short rest
	- META: Rem asked Hyphithia about any cures for the secomortis plague.
		- She said it was a blight thrust upon the mortals for slaying Karz, a manifestation of his pain and loss but a symbol of his resurrection. The cure isn't for all, but one. Because no knowledge of a cure exists, she doesn't know what it is. 
		- He asked if Jonas's "cure" was possible, she said it was more of putting the condition into remission.
		- The cause is the remains of Karz. The sap is the life essence being sucked out of those afflicted with the secomortis plague, so it can also provide relief.
