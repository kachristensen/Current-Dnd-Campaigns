###### Day 24
## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Ria
>

## Notes
- Rem cured wounds Lewis 
	- Random dude Radomir said he was our party member, as if totally normal, only Ria and I thought it was unusual, Rem and Lewis and Valindra acted as if normal. Rem healed him. 
		- I dispel magicked Rem but it didn't seem to do anything. He gave us a scroll of teleportation, had coordinates on it. I took it and refused to cast it. I teleported Lewis up with a Fey Step into acid.
