## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Ria
>

## Notes
- Rem cured wounds Lewis 
	- Random dude Radomir said he was our party member, as if totally normal, only Ria and I thought it was unusual, Rem and Lewis and Valindra acted as if normal. Rem healed him. 
		- I dispel magicked Rem but it didn't seem to do anything. He gave us a scroll of teleportation, had coordinates on it. I took it and refused to cast it. I teleported Lewis up with a Fey Step into acid.
		- They argued, I told them I'd only use the scroll if Radomir killed himself, he refused, said he'd stay, Rem offered to stay with him. I told Rem to divine sense, he sensed celestial, Radomir transformed into Dietarch. Rem, Valindra, and Lewis all returned to normal. 
			- He said the tp scroll takes us 60 ft outside of the house. Ria cast it, bardic inspo + enhance ability
- We tp'd out front, house boss. Our friends in the barn were in a resilient sphere.
	- Dietarch kissed Lewis, who healed for 62.
	- House is resistant to psychic and necrotic
	- Valindra used Summon Fey for the first time, little irridescent purple dragon with antlers
- After
	- I turned down Lewis's healing 
	- I asked why Dietarch spared the two of us of the duplicity, he said it was more fun that way. He turned into Ysolde and pulled out the silver dildo on a stick
	- I asked what he wanted - he wants to lend a helping hand, got the gods attention.
