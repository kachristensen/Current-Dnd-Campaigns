## Summary


## IC Synopsis - Ria
>

## Notes
- Rem cured wounds Lewis 
	- Random dude Radomir said he was our party member, as if totally normal, only Ria and I thought it was unusual, Rem and Lewis and Valindra acted as if normal. Rem healed him. 
		- I dispel magicked Rem but it didn't seem to do anything. He gave us a scroll of teleportation, had coordinates on it. I took it and refused to cast it. I teleported Lewis up with a Fey Step into acid.
		- They argued, I told them I'd only use the scroll if Radomir killed himself, he refused, said he'd stay, Rem offered to stay with him. I told Rem to divine sense, he sensed celestial, Radomir transformed into **Dietarch**. Rem, Valindra, and Lewis all returned to normal. 
			- He said the tp scroll takes us 60 ft outside of the house. Ria cast it, bardic inspo + enhance ability
- We tp'd out front, house boss. Our friends in the barn were in a resilient sphere.
	- Dietarch kissed Lewis, who healed for 62.
	- House is resistant to psychic and necrotic
	- Valindra used Summon Fey for the first time, little irridescent purple dragon with antlers
- After
	- I turned down Lewis's healing 
	- I asked why Dietarch spared the two of us of the duplicity, he said it was more fun that way. He turned into Ysolde and pulled out the silver dildo on a stick
	- I asked what he wanted - he wants to lend a helping hand, got the gods attention. The house has the ability to trap us inside of itself, short of a spell to bend reality, we weren't getting out of there. 
	- He knows we have important items on us, and one that belongs to the living god. He doesn't think mortals should have them and it was a mistake to let us have them. He wanted to pass some wisdom on Zarunok - said Z is a meddler. The more the gods get involved, the worse the world becomes. Be cautioned with what he wants us to do - it won't be so simple when it comes to Rem's agreement with him. D doesn't know the specifics but is guessing Z wants to impose order and rule. Valindra told D Z wanted someone to take control. Like a new Rexum.
		- D told us about Rexums' mental state - our mortal bodies and minds can't wield such powers. It broke the Rexum's mind and created a monster. 
			- Rem said we don't intend to let one person use all of them. Said we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past but will use what we can. D asked about the fruit. 
			- D says he's fine with mortal meddling, just not the gods. D says he likes mortals and is tired of us destroying ourselves. 
			- D said it was Karz's idea to choose a champion. He said we could use the fruit to resurrect Karz. Rem said he just wants to end the plague.
			- Rem asked what D wants us to do. He said he wants us to try without relying on the strength of the gods. He said we could probably face the Rexum on our own.
			- Rem asked what about fighting the gods. Perse interjected and asked if the gods intended to deal with godly affairs - that there are many threats that are trying to devour Skediwen. He says he believe they can and have been doing their best/trying. I told them to do better. He circled me. Perse was uncomfortable. 
			- D tried to remove Ria's glasses. She backed up. Said there's no need for her to live in a prison of her own design. D said she doesn't let anyone close to her, like she's locking herself up. Ria clarified it was a fortress/bulwark, not a prison. 
				- D joked he was going to tell the others about his and Ria's sexual escapades had the charade gone on longer
		- Lewis asked about the living god, D said he's neutral on it. The LG snuck in and doesn't belong. D doesn't agree with what he's trying to do. Said it's trying to save a world that is long since gone - things are different now and require a different approach. 
			- Lewis thanked D on behalf of the group for getting us out of the house. D told us to take care and he will be watching. 
- We rested in the barn
	- Ria said there was something we needed to discuss in the morning
	- Valindra/Rhenka looked among the house, found Tori unconscious, she bound him. 
		- 1,400 GP in coinage:
		- 140 PP
		- Dust of Dryness
		- Scroll of Protection from Celestials
		- Eyedrops of Clarity
		- Iron Belly
		- 3 Potion of Holistic Wellness
	- I went and burned some bits of the house
		- Cloak of the Manta Ray
	- Ria's convo - we left the NPCs out
		- She said she received another vision from the Harbinger of the Insect Queen, it is trying to corrupt her - knowledge is an infection. She handed a folded and sealed letter to Rembrandt and Persephone. In the event it is necessary to kill her, these are instructions - what to do with her corpse and who to reach out for assistance in her absence. She also tucked away a third copy into her stuff. 
			- She said much of the corruption has manifested physically, she will submit herself to regular inspection.
