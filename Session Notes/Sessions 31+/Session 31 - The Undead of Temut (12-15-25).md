	- META: Rem and Lewis conversed, Rem asked if Lewis was alright and wanted to talk about it. Lewis said he shouldn't press on Ria too much. Lewis wasn't sure what he did to upset Perse.

	- Ria and Perse snuck up on the roof
	- The boys led by Rem went to talk to the mercenaries, Rem introduced himself as a Cathar who helps people in need.
		- Some of the mercenaries mumbled to themselves, thought Rem was there to deal with the undead issue. They asked Rem how the roads were, he said infested with undead. The mercenaries said they've came across some undead but should be safe in town. They asked if we were here to aid with the undead. Rem said he wouldn't leave things unsettled and asked about what they know.
		- The mercs have been in the area for months now. Undead are migrating southward from Valdrheim. Temut is safe for now and they can still do business here.
		- Mercs work for someone in the Temut, here for security. They offered Rem some slaves for contract. Rem asked if their master would facilitate the sale. They said yes. They're contracted under **Lord Antoine**.
		- **Countess Tessarae Harker** has been organizing nightly militia watches, leads the city. **Lord Dareth** has also been stressing the importance of safety, and is also a large purchaser of slaves. They are stationed here in town. Auction tomorrow when these slaves will be revealed.
		- Curfew will be enacted in 20 min at sunset and the local guard will be rough with anyone breaking it. There's an inn we can stay at.
