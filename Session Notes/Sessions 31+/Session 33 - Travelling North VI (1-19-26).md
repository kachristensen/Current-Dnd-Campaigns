## IC Synopsis - Lewis
>The crevasse swallowed sound as we stepped inside it. Stone walls rose like frozen jaws, the cold pressing in until breath itself felt brittle. Shadows clung to the rocks—then one of them moved.A ghast burst from the dark, its shriek tearing through the canyon. Persephone vanished into the brush as Ria’s voice cracked like thunder, barking a command that snapped us into motion. Rem answered instantly, surging forward, steel flashing as he carved into the creature and planted himself between us and the dead.Holy power flared as I raised my symbol, forcing the undead back in a wave of radiant will. But the canyon answered with betrayal, archers revealed themselves above, arrows raining down, clattering off stone, grazing air where I had stood a heartbeat before.Ria lifted her hands and the winds obeyed. Fly. Anica rose skyward, and Rem followed, launching himself upward like a spear hurled by the gods. His blade struck a wraith mid-air, light exploding on impact as the creature reeled, blinded and screaming.Far above us, Valindra ran straight up the mountainside, boots finding impossible purchase. She reached an archer and cut into them without hesitation, steel biting deep. Another wraith slipped away, dissolving into the rocks like smoke fleeing a fire.Persephone stepped forward, fearless, shouting commands at the dead mocking them, daring them to close the distance.I answered with a Guiding Bolt.
  Radiance slammed into a wight, marking it in burning light but it struck back, faster than expected. Necrotic energy lashed out, ripping vitality from Valindra and dropping her hard.Before the dead could press their advantage, Lord Welmer stout, grizzled, and unyielding drew and fired. Two arrows flew true, thudding into the glowing white and slowing its advance.Then Ria ended the standoff.Fire bloomed in the canyon. A Fireball detonated, incinerating a ghast in an instant, heat and light tearing through the cold like a scream. Rem landed amid the chaos and cut down a wight with a single, merciless swing.Valindra rose, fury burning brighter than her wounds. She drove a white back step by step then shoved it over the edge. It vanished into the depths below, its scream swallowed by the crevasse.One remained.The last wight stood glowing, hesitating until Persephone met its gaze. She smiled, calm and terrible, and said one word.“Run.”The white obeyed.It turned, leapt from the cliff, and shattered far below.  Silence returned to the crevasse. The dead lay scattered or broken in the depths, the cold once again the only thing left standing. We gathered ourselves, breathing hard, victorious and alive.
  After the fight we meet a new and unexpected face, Lord Welmer, an older gentleman that owns a piece of land out in such a remote destination.(sketchy if you ask me) However we follow him to his Sanatorium that he states “has helped cure ailment and mainly respiratory issues.  I am still pissed to have such luck at finding a place of healing and yet its not to the standards I was hopping for we walk into his place i take off my shoes and bag and give it the the bell boy… why on earth would he be here… we sit at this table that sits each of us comfortably waiting for what Lord Welmer has so say.
  Future Lewis here Rem finally told us about that day when he talked to Hypithia during our trip. Here is what he said:-Secomortis isn’t a sickness, it’s a god’s wound.
  -Karz died this is his pain made real.
  -No true cure exists. Jonas only slows it down
  -The sap helps because it’s stolen life.
  -The tree is a vessel — for Karz’s rebirth, or something worse.
  -Fruit ripens in ~6 months
  -Whoever eats it cures the plague.
  -Only the god who made it can end it for good.


## Notes
- Valindra gave Ailbhe a bow. Aibhe will probably need a wizard to best learn magic.
- Short rest
	- META: Rem asked Hyphithia about any cures for the secomortis plague.
		- She said it was a blight thrust upon the mortals for slaying Karz, a manifestation of his pain and loss but a symbol of his resurrection. The cure isn't for all, but one. Because no knowledge of a cure exists, she doesn't know what it is. 
		- He asked if Jonas's "cure" was possible, she said it was more of putting the condition into remission.
		- The cause is the remains of Karz. The sap is the life essence being sucked out of those afflicted with the secomortis plague, so it can also provide relief. 
		- The plague shall remain in this world as a reminder of what happens when those who oppose the gods succeed. But the tree is a vessel in which all this life energy is being connected - possible for rebirth of Karz, or ascension of something else.
		- Only the one who created the plague can truly eradicate it. Once the fruit finally matures and is consumed, that is when the rebirth will happen. Will happen within 6 months. Those in power have been biding their time. Whoever consumes the fruit can cure the plague.
- Later - gully/small canyon. Temp dropped, feeling of dread. We killed a shadowghast. Some shadowy being called out "drained them of their life" and hovered up to the top.
	- Ria cast fly on Annica, we flew up. We saw a human rider also riding in our direction. Shouted tally ho and came to our rescue.
	- We killed the things. 
	- Guy on the horse (Betsy). Lord Whalmer of the Sanitorium. Said he'd meet us at the edge of the gully.
		- I told him we were escorting friends north.
		- He patrols these woods to make it safe from the undead. He runs a sanatorium nearby, always looking for those to help. It predates the secomortis plague. It's built to be remote, secluded, to help those no matter the ailment. A lot of his fortune is tied in with it so he didn't leave when the undead encroached. He invited us to stay. Seemed noble and altruistic. 
		- His cane seems celestial somewhat.
		- We skirted around rem's condition, didn't mention the secomortis plague. 
		- He does have some staff. Didn't have much medical treatment. 
		- Ria history check - he used to be a templar, left the military ~40 years ago bc he couldn't handle it. One of the few good/nice nobles.
		- He was surprised that Valindra spoke and in broken elvish greeted her.
- Sanatorium
	- Rhenka stayed in the barn due to size
