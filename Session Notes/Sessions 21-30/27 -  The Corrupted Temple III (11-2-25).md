###### Day 21

## Summary
The party cleared out the rest of the temple, discovering the same cultists as the ones under Maghaven. They returned to Porto and spoke with Mastenovti, learning more of Persephone's origins and her husband's betrothal to Xch'imaltia. Rem and Perse had a heated conversation about her request to travel to the underworld.

## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> **The Stars Beneath the Earth**
> 
> how quickly songs fade
   words become expensive
   they
       fall
   here        and          there
   with no rhyme or reason
              I weep.
   melody into dirge
   and yet beholden
      I try.
   /
   Our noble adventurers, tried and true!
   Ventured verily forth unto eldritch wailing
   Against insectoid creature born freshly anew
   Our mighty spells and blades prevailing
   /
   Ere departing we discovered a dastardly plot
   To create more of them via corruption and sin
   we question the corpse and 
   set flame
       blazing
          hot
          **it burns**
    and
   Returned to the entrance whence we did begin!
   /
   With decapitated head decayed on my hip
   We merrily maketh our trip
   Back to Porto, that loveable scamp
   What scallywag, what rascal, what adorable tramp!
   /
   With Valindra procuring a stag with ample blood
   And Porto's runes scored into the mud
   No handsomer, nor caliber, nor cheeks quite as rosy
   As the perky and cheerful Lord Mastenovti! 
   /
   Ho ho, ha ha, what amusing coincidence!
   Such fortune, such luck, such divine deliverance!
   He informs us of a bargain, in which struck
   Sees us slaying his rival, the poor sorry fuck 
   In exchange for an artifact of god-killing significance
   /
   And then I am made
   He knows of my sins
   In his desire to persuade
   He tells me of him
   /
   Hades is not dead
   Nor is he alive
   Betrothed
   Revived?
   To the goddess X'chimaltia
   Sharing his domain
   /
   And I know joy.
   /
   I am twenty again. My hands strum the lute, and his strum mine. To forsake the surface is no troubling task, when the stars are in his skin, and the moon in his eyes. He pulls the galaxy below ground. The heavens were never above, but below, where he strung them in dancing motes, and hung them from the balconies in soft everlasting light. I know him as well as I know myself. For two hundred years, we are one, mine right his and his mine. I garden and grow, and over time, we change. From imperfection and sin we create new life.
   /
   He is the most perfect thing we have ever made.
   /
   We should have known better. For a time, we partake in my maiden sky--the stars though distant, still present. They are still there under your skin when I curl up next to you. Your body was still warm. The mountains are cold, but the fire drowns out his cries and burn away our transgressions. My blood, my flesh, my dread, my soul. You are gone, and I follow.
   /
   ...
   ...
   ...
   Questions follow. I answer them to my abilities. Valindra, my darling, speaks our tongue, so she hears what is said. How strange it is to find this youth, this elven woman, who knows the barest glimmer of our histories. She knows of you, and I cannot but help to share my joy with her. They bruised her body and heart and mind, but not her soul. She is pure. She is grace and love, beauty and kindness, and I burst so wholly with such things that I cannot help but pour them into her.
   / 
   Time has passed. Things are different. Two years have elapsed since I was brought back to this realm, and made to live in this alien world. I am still a ghost struggling to find form. A wraith without meaning. But I still walk forward, and sometimes when I laugh or smile it is genuine, and it is in those precious moments I know my love for you has never diminished.
   /
   We set up camp.
   Lewis sends Theron our plans.
   We discuss Mastenovti's proposal.
   We elect to continue to Valdrheim.
   /
   Of Rem, I remember  
   His golden sun splendor
   A smile to die for
   A man worth an eye for?
   A time where his arms held me aloft
   And carried me over a river crossed
   The noble and knightly
   Selfless and kindly
   Rembrant Eifert
   /
   Only now his light diminishes
   His cold indifference eclipses
   A once easy smile, a playful grin
   The proffered strength, the radiance within
   Are now but fading glimpses
   Of what what once was and what could have been
   /
   He makes himself clear.
   If to the underworld we head, he won't be coming with.
   Lewis, brave and ever dear
   Forges loyalties adamantine-smithed
   And lets me know I won't be going alone
   /
   Valindra seconds him, eager to please
   Ria keeps quiet as to whether she disagrees
   And with lines in the sand starkly drawn
   An eternity lies before us to await the dawn
   /
   Lewis conjures a plan to consume the brain
   Of Saint Imelda's priestess, so as to obtain
   The reasons behind her eldritch corruption
   To assist in his efforts of investigation and deduction
   /
   Ria makes no secret she thinks his idea is stupid
   Asserting that killing him is well within her ability
   Of her time with Valindra, their watch together is muted
   Though there is a easing of rage, and the sharing of tea
   /
   Of Valindra and I, she asked more of my history
   And thus did I oblige, dispelling the mystery
   Of my life beforehand and the strange circumstance
   Which did in a way give me the chance
   To meet someone as pure and well-intentioned as she
   And in her, a friend with to weather time's advance
   /
   I approached Rem during our final shift
   'Twas not an argument or rivalry I wished
   Yet in doing so, we traded our blows
   My angered frustration and weeping woes
   Were dispassionately dismissed
   And the silence and tension that followed
   The aching hurt that left myself hollow
   Only proved to show
   That a Cathar cannot coexist
		with
   /
   for if you see a ploy instead of vulnerability
   and manipulation instead of honesty
   if my tears to you are lies
   if my pain to you is a deception
   then to you I will only ever be
                        a
               demon.

## Notes
- Prayer of Healing
	- Bardic Inspiration on Lewis
	- Enemies start to decay/sludge on death
- Door to the next room - stone, exudes a feeling of weakness - losing hp aura. Loud wail, exhaustion to Wuffi.
	- Altar with egg, candles, food. Egg has burst open. 2 Human bodies webbed. Baby humanoid insect bee thing at the edge of the table, eating flesh. Wail - exhaustion to many of us. Valindra silenced it. Bug did the uppies motion. Rem killed it.
	- Corpses - human male and female, 20s. Were living until an hour ago, freshly dead. Egg recently hatched. 
	- Mural - has been painted over, instead of St. Imelda, is XI'Talla. Crowds and masses of screaming writhing humans, giant bug goddess, burning flames and smoke. 
	- Ria and I arcana'd - egg is the same one we saw in the sewers of Maghaven. Hybrid between human and insect, tainted, trying to be grown as a vessel, but came out deformed. Method is trying to be perfected.
	- Lewis cast speak with dead
		- How long have you been captured? 
			- I don't know what you mean.
		- You were a part of this ritual?
			- Indeed.
		- What was the point of building this settlement underneath the temple?
			- To be closer to her.
		- Was there anything inside the temple worth grabbing?
			- Just the priestess, I suppose.
		- Where is the priestess now?
			- I don't know.
		- Corpse continued to look at Lewis and speak with him even after the 5 questions. 
			- What were your plans for the priestess?
				- The lady of the temple became part of the hive and administered the final rites. 
				- "Lewis, your mother is calling."
			- Where is my mother?
				- She sleeps below. She awaits for her children to wake her up. Please wake me up, Lewis. 
			- And how would I wake you up?
				- repeated - please wake me up Lewis.
			- Lewis brained it with his mace. Tore down the painting and lit it afire. 
	- Rem looked for buttons/hidden passageways. This section is part of the temple but was cemented off long ago.
	- Perse cut off the head of the heirophant and put it in the bag of holding
	- Burned all and left the temple
- We returned to Porto
	- Lewis asked Rem about an item that should've been the temple, they didn't see it. Thanked him for looking.
	- Porto has been scribing weird symbols into the ground. Surprised we came back so quickly. 
		- Abyssal - can't tell much more about the ritual. Communication ritual. 
		- Needs about as much blood as an adult human, must be mortal. 
			- Valindra went hunting, Perse assisted with Bardic Inspo. Valindra took down a young elk. 
				- Porto says good for 80%, will need some extra blood.
				- Valindra was very willing, Perse squinted at her.
				- Ria has no objections so long as the circle is disposed of.
				- Lewis was willing, took out a dagger.
				- Rem abstained.
	- Ritual - we dripped the remaining blood. Porto pulled out a mirror. Needs a person to touch it, Perse touched it. 
		- Temperature dropped in the circle, a voice.
			- Mastenovti asked if I was familiar with him. I said perhaps.
			- He needs a group of powerful individuals. Asked why our interest in powerful artifacts. Said the items we seek are connected to the gods. The essence that makes them what they are are not solely of divine, he can make them as well. What he needs to craft such an item is the body of a powerful demon. Competition. Wants us to take out a rival of his. Pick one of the remaining three.
				- I questioned why they haven't unified, can only be through conquest.
				- The humans aren't important, need to get rid of the gods who are holding back the essence of the abyss. Have grown stale from lack of contact.
					- He was trying to fish why he was familiar with me - I told him he should look to his history books/memory. He asked Porto to describe me to him, they conferred in Abyssal. 
					- He says my husband is betrothed to Xchi'maltia. His kingdom has been left to an inferior, let it rot. All of his rivals live in the underdark. We'll need to meet in person to discuss - deliver the body of his rival and craft the weapon. 
					- I told them we would speak again. 
				- Party conversed. I told them of my history and Hades. Dying, resurrecting in the mountains in the northwest. 
		- I asked as a favor that they come with. Lewis was with me, as was Valindra. 
			- META: Ria wondering if my joy is blinding me. Jim asked Chris about what he knows of visiting the underworld -- its a fantasy, no one goes there unless worshipping demons, heretical. Asked about marriage, gods are supposedly infertile, forbidden from having offspring. Ely asked about demon couples - era was very competitive, used humans as proxies for war, had alliances but those usually crumbled. Not out of the question for there to be romantic alliances. 
		- Rem seems reserved, guarded. Said has reservations about the Rexum but wants no part in upending the Grand Divine. Would be fine to slay a demon lord, but Mastenovti's plans are concerning. 
		- Porto said he knows of a path to get there. 
			- Verlatenland, former city is said to have fallen into the Abyss long ago, considered a portal to hell.
			- Valindra dropped Valdrheim, Porto recommended we visit beforehand.
			- Long way over the river would be like a month of travel. Porto knows a way that would be faster, closer here.
- Tiny Hut
	- We discussed what to do next. Decided to inform Theron. Rem wants to be cured before we visit Mastenovti.
	- Perse asked Valindra why she speaks Abyssal. 
		- All in the Veridian Scales can speak Abyssal. Their stories/histories came from the demons, the one who wrote them down. When they're told to them, they're spoken in Abyssal. Draconic was left to the higher ranking more devout.  The dragons spoke oral history, destroyed a lot of the demons, so those who knew the histories of the demons preserved it. Demons kept very detailed records. 
	- Lewis sent message to Theron - Agnes is dead, bracer is ours, dolls may not be in surplus. What other artifacts are available for procurement?
		- Theron asked about the heart, Lewis said it was still out of reach. We're coming up with a better plan for future endeavor.
			- 2 Artifacts in Valdrheim - shield and chains. Shield of Forsherey. Chains of Zaronach. Valdrheim has seen a massive increase in spirits due to concentration of artifacts - full frontal assault not practical. 
			- Theron asked if he should send someone to pick up artifacts, Lewis said we'll bring back none or all as agreed.
		- Valindra asked what my husband's name was, Hades. Her history books do mention him. 
		- Rem wants to go to Valdrheim, said he'd never go to the underworld. 
		- Ria said we are less beholden to Mastenovti than the Rexum. 
		- I said I don't mind going to Valdrheim first, but if we don't ever go to the underdark, I will part ways with them.  Lewis said he was with me, as did Valindra. 
	- I failed dispelling the tome again, Rem Enhanced Abilitied me.
- Watches
	- Ria and Lewis
		- Lewis pulled some brain matter out of the skull of the hierophant. Said he was preparing for tomorrow, a spell. Ria asked what. He wants to know why she turned/gave up. Ria said the entity's influence spreads like an infection, said to take care it doesn't root itself in him. She'd have to kill him. Lewis said he'll consume the mind of that person. Ria asked why. He said he'd sit on it. Ria warned against the corruption. Lewis asked for our support in the morning. Ria called him stupid.
			- Grim Hollow - Consume Mind spell
	- Valindra and Ria
		- not much to say - Ria seems irritated. Valindra asked for tea. 
	- Valindra and Perse
		- She asked about my history, what it was like. I told her much about it. Love, ruling, our son. 
		- We talked about Rem some. Hugged. Said in our long lives we would be friends.
	- Rem and Perse
		- Terse conversation, Rem said Perse had plenty of opportunities to confide in him. She said he wasn't ready and he's treated her rudely since then.
		- He asked what my end goal is, I said I don't know, just to learn, the others can decide the fate of Skediwen. He asked what we did as Demon Lords, I likened it to feudalism, we controlled a portion of the underworld. He questioned if we wanted to rule again, I said I thought the demons had their turn, thought the humans should have theirs. 
		- I told him he was a dog following his leash, he said I should try harder to pull his leash. I wasn't. I was trying to make peace with him but didn't have much to work with.
		- He said give him a reason, Perse cried and yelled at him, said he needs us on the same side, as a team. He needs us, unless he intends to fight us all. 
		- I reiterated I didn't need the artifacts, he could take the others after Valdrheim, she would leave. I like some of the party. She loves her husband and wants to find out what happened to him and their son. Said she was sorry for everything he is going through and what she put him through.
		- She wishes him well. He doesn't wish her ill will and would help, but not go into the underworld. Was cold, said I needed to confide in them and continue to give reason for them to trust in her. He'd consider it.
