## Summary


## IC Synopsis - 
> Given recent decisions, I see little reason to continue compiling mission reports. However, it seems prudent to maintain some record of events as we carry on. I will do my best to maintain a comprehensive account. I suppose we can tell ourselves it is for the sake of posterity. 
   This past night Persephone, with Rembrandt’s aid, was finally able to open the tome we recovered from the black dragon’s hoard. I’m told she was struck by a sudden sense of lethargy upon opening the book, but was able to shrug it off with little trouble. Initial examination of the book revealed little beyond blank pages, until Rem’s divine senses clued him in to the presence of some sort of entity contained within. 
   Attempting to speak to this entity proved the more successful approach, as it was able to respond in writing, and otherwise expressed some level of outside awareness. Through questioning this entity, it was revealed they were called Hypithia, a bound god of knowledge, truth, lies, madness, and secrets, both created and sealed away by the Grand Divine itself when it was deemed Hypithia knew too much.
   According to this entity, they were the fourth born of the gods under the Grand Divine, one of twelve rather than the ten the people of Skediwen know. Supposedly, Yaluska of the Mire is another of the unknown gods, the third born, and took magic for herself in order to break away from the Grand Divine and live freely here on the mortal plane. It may behoove us after all to find her, if this is the case… An issue for another time.
   Likewise, and attempts to release this Hypithia from their bindings will have to wait, as doing so requires either the sacrifice of an artifact or the combined use of five, either created by the Grand Divine, or at a minimum of similar power. Needless to say, we are reluctant to do so at this time. In the meantime we all must consider whether to release Hypithia at all. For now, Rem remains in possession of the tome, having expressed a desire to converse with its prisoner further. Unfortunately, Hypithia’s ability is stunted by their bindings, but even then we have access to a veritable well of knowledge, and divining magics. If nothing else, we would do well to make use of this. 
   Night watch proved largely uneventful during my shifts. I reexamined Doctor Jonas’ notes with Persephone’s aid, but we learned precious little in the way of new information. Would that we had access to a laboratory and proper equipment. More than that, would that we had sufficient time. Seven days remain before the full moon, and presumably Rembrandt’s imminent lycanthropic transformation, and subsequent curse removal. I do wish to respect his reticence regarding experimentation, and his desire to be cured, but for all the oaths we swore to him, I doubt his blood will be of any use should he go through with eradicating the lycanthropy he contracted from Jonas… Perhaps something unexpected will happen… Though I’d prefer not to get my hopes up needlessly. 
   Valindra offered apology during our shift together. In turn, I expressed appreciation for her intervention with Lewis earlier, before I turned the man into a smoldering corpse. He is, unfortunately, a necessary member of the party, despite— [several of the next words are scratched out, to the point of illegibility.
   Still, I should not grow complacent, nor incautious. The matter of the dragon remains as yet unresolved. I will not give it the opportunity of a lowered guard. 
   During the final watch, between Valindra and Lewis, strange lights were spotted in the distance, along the road ahead of us. Given that Rem had sensed traces of undeath in the area, it was presumed that these were will-o-wisps. A concerning sighting indeed, given our proximity to Temut, and the long way we should have had left to travel before encountering such things. 
   Given we found even more undead as we approached town, there is some concern the settlement has been overrun. Indeed, the very land itself seemed cursed. Darkness fell far earlier than it should have at this time of year, and investigations following our battle with the undead on the road revealed they had been attempting to dig up bodies from the site of a battle long since passed. Notably, one even seemed intelligent; an armored figure which rode a skeletal horse seemed to be directing its fellows when we arrived. 
   We must know more… and so we shall, however we can. Given the circumstances, we elected to try investigating the town, ideally quietly.

## Notes
- Ladies returned, dome back up, watch
	- Rem and Perse
		- Perse opened the tome, int save but passed, feeling of being drunk briefly. Pages empty. Rem got the lantern of revealing. His divine sense revealed it to be celestial, like a creature. Told it to reveal itself in celestial. Words wrote out "why should I?"
			- Rem said we freed it from its bindings. Does it know where it was kept before that. 
				- It hasn't been fully released from its bindings. Rem asked what it is -- it's something of great knowledge. Knows what we wish to learn. Though it's not to be trusted. 
				- Perse asked if it could lie, he said he's all of knowledge, truth and lies included.
			- Rem asked what it's purpose was. Does it serve a greater power. Response: technically yes. Purpose to hold the knowledge and secrets of this world. To keep the secrets of the grand divine. The grand divine created it.  Rem asked how to release it. Tome said we already have the tools we need, it's being bound by magic created by the GD itself. Needs a counterbalance. It knows too much. 
			- Tome knows the GD's true purpose. Tome said its knowledge could come with a cost. What is truth is in the eye of the beholder. Rem asked its name. **Hypithia**. Something created by the GD's magic, or an equivalent would work. Would require that one of the artifacts be destroyed. In return, it could give us a different item. If multiple items were used, could counteract the need to destroy them (5 needed total). 
				- Rem suggested we wait for the 5. Book asked if it told Rem it was a god, would that help? Rem was thoughtful. Book said it was one of 12 Divine - we know of 10 including Karz. Yaluska of the Mire is the other one. 
					- I asked why they aren't known. Yaluska is the 3rd born, she used magic to break away from the GD. Hypithia is the 4th, was sealed away due to its knowledge. I asked why. GD is complicated entity, Yaluska wanted free will. Opening it would piss off the GD.
					- Hypithia is the god of knowledge and secrets. Said to know too much was to be mad. I asked if she was mad, she said depends but kinda.
			- Perse handed Rem the tome, said she was curious but the tome was integral to Rem's beliefs/beings so he should hold it. 
				- If we close the book it goes dormant.
				- Perse asked if the int save would happen again, it said it was like it was yawning, shouldn't happen to the same degree again.
			- Perse asked about Xchimaltia (1st born) and Hades. A deal was made. Ink becoming harder to read. Zarunok. Servants. Book only knows so much. We let it rest and will check on it in a day or so. 
			- Perse teased Rem about having a god in his pocket.
		- Rem had a faint sense of undeath towards the direction we were headed.
		- Hypithia can cast **Augury, Borrowed Knowledge, Clairvoyance, Divination, Legend Lore** without material costs. Depending on the spell's level, that is the number of days before a new spell can be used.
	- Ria and Perse
		- Perse asked if she should try and keep Lewis away from her, she said yes.
		- They talked about Jonas's notes. Perse isn't sure what to do -- we can't preserve the blood, test it on victims, can't set up a lab, Rem's going to be cured. We reviewed his notes, 2 things pitting against each other nullify each other. Secomortis is divine. Boosted lycanthropy could "counteract" it. Still missing some kind of piece, due to the threat of shifting into a werewolf. 
			- Ria suggested we slightly dissect Rem - when Jonas was killed, he was putrid/rotten as if dead for weeks. Perse suggested we wait until he's wounded to take a look. Both mentioned Rem seemed to be adverse to being experimented on. We mentioned we'd talk to the book about it when it was next awake.
	- Ria and Valindra
		- Valindra apologized for intervening with Lewis without asking, Ria said it saved Lewis's life, she appreciates it, encouraged Valindra to use her best discretion. Valindra she said witnessing Lewis made her appreciate what Perse said before and understand why Ria is upset with her. Valindra apologized for stalking her and left it at that. 
	- Valindra and Lewis
		- Lewis thanked V again for pulling him away earlier from Ria.
		- Something down the road during watch but it left by morning
- Next day
	- Evening - travelling to Temut. We came across will-o-wisps. Closer to Temut = darker it got. Soldiers standing scattered on the road. Spectral soldiers, wights, zombies, undead knight horseman supervising the wights digging into the ground, giant Oblivion Juggernaut wrapped in leather and armor.
		- We mopped them up
		- Seems like this was the site of an older battle
