## Summary
Several members of the party experienced eerie dreams and discussed them together. They travelled north, passing an odd woman Isolde, and encountered bandits.

## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> I wake inside the bubble dome. It’s quiet—too quiet. The air feels heavy, pressing down against my chest, and the place is empty. No movement, no warmth. Just the faint hum of something long dead still pretending to breathe. The glass above me shows no sky, only a dull haze stretching forever.  I step outside. The world has changed. The forest beyond is a corpse—blackened trunks rising like bones, branches bent and twisted toward a colorless sky. The earth crunches beneath my boots, soft with ash and rot. There’s no wind, only the faint sound of things crawling just out of sight.  And then I see them—the Living God. They stand among the dead trees, light flickering weakly around them like a candle about to die. Their voice echoes through the still air, telling me I’ve drawn the attention of their sister.  The Living God’s voice falters. They tremble, as though something unseen is pulling them apart. They drop to their knees, reaching toward me. “Take my hand,” they whisper. At first I pulled away, not able to commit myself fully to the living god. I see they are in pain, “I can’t turn away someone in this state, I take their hand.Their flesh gives way. Their hand collapses into a spill of maggots that writhe over my palm and drop into the soil. I stagger back, but before I can speak, I hear it—the Hierophant’s laughter. It slithers through the forest, echoing off the hollow trunks, loud and mocking and everywhere at once.The Living God begins to melt. Their face dissolves, their light flickers out, and all that remains is a pool of glistening decay spreading through the ash. The laughter rises and rises until it drowns everything—until it’s all I can hear.And then—silence. I’m back in the circle, gasping, the scent of the dead forest still thick in my lungs staring at the others as they awaken.We took turns describing our dreams as the others awoke in stress and anger.  Persephone, not bothered by dreams, pressed each of us to describe what we saw.
   “Ria said it began with a smell—incense, thick and sweet, like the kind burned in cathedral halls. When she opened her eyes, she was already there: a vast, hollow church, lit only by the faint glow of dying candles.The pews were empty, the air unmoving, but she wasn’t alone.another figure kneeling at the altar.“At first, she thought it was just a trick of the dream. But when the woman lifted her head, Ria knew her. It was her sister—Maja.  Ria pauses, letting the name hang in the air. “Ria called out, testing her magic, the sound of her own voice echoing strangely. Her sister was whispering something—soft, hurried, like a prayer. Ria stepped closer, and the words became clear: ‘Ria, don’t come back.’ “That was all she said at first. Ria asked if that was really all her sister had to tell her after so long apart. She said she was coming home—to repay debts, to make things right. But when she asked where Maja had been, the silence stretched thin. Then Maja turned.”The voice drops to a near whisper.“Her eyes were gone. Just hollow sockets, and from them crawled hornets, golden and black, slipping in and out like they’d made a hive of her skull. Ria stumbled back, asking how this had happened.“Maja told her—‘Our mother is not the only mother with influence.’”Ria shakes their head slowly.“Ria pressed her again, begging her to say where she was. But Maja only smiled, said she couldn’t—that it was to protect her. And then, softer still: ‘I do love you, dear sister.’“Before the dream faded, Ria swore to her in one last whisper. I will find you.’ Ria eyes drawing daggers at her next victim though she stared into what remained of the fire, you could see she was already cutting the head of her next victim.
   “…It started in a cell,” Rem says quietly, rubbing the back of his neck as though the memory still clings to him. “Not just any cell—that cell. The one under Jonas’s house. The walls were the same cold stone, the air thick with iron and old blood. For a moment, I thought I’d gone back.”  He pauses, glancing at the others before continuing.  “Then I saw him. Jonas. Sitting on the old autopsy table, alive somehow. His clothes were torn, bloodstained, but there he was—chewing on a pear, like nothing had ever happened. He looked at me, smiled that same calm smile of his, and said, ‘Ah, so you’re awake! How are you, Rem?’”  Rem exhales through his nose. “I told him, ‘Times are trying.’ Didn’t know what else to say.”  “He started talking then—about the cure. Said it lived in me. Said that between his lycanthropy and my blood, there was something… divine, something that could heal the sickness in others. That I could cure the masses if I just kept it. If I didn’t fight what I was becoming.”  Rem’s hand tightens unconsciously on his knee. “I told him that cure was tainted. That it was born of demon blood and moonlight—hardly the kind of thing that saves people. He just smiled again and said, ‘Keep it anyway. Use it for good.’”  “We talked about dreams. I told him I dreamed of running—of feeling the wind and the wild without the fear. He told me he dreamed of tearing apart the people he once cared for. Said maybe that was balance.”  Rem shakes his head slowly.
   “Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a key. Held it out to me. Said, ‘You can do good, Rem. Will you let yourself out… or will you stay in the cell?’”He goes quiet for a beat, then adds, “I told him there’d always be other cages.”  “Still, I took the key. The moment my hand closed around it, everything faded—the cell, Jonas, the smell of blood and rot. I woke up right after. Valindra was shaking me for my watch.”  He stares into the fire, voice low. “I don’t know if it was just a dream. But it felt real. And the worst part? …I still feel the key in my hand.”
   Valindra speaks softly, her tone thoughtful, as though the dream still clings to her mind like the scent of smoke.  “When I finally drifted into trance, I found myself standing at the edge of a pool—a grotto, warm and dimly lit. The water shimmered like liquid glass, reflecting soft light against the stone. And there was someone in it. A woman.”  She pauses, eyes distant.  “She rose from the water—completely bare, unashamed. It was Vera Fontaine. Her hair clung to her skin, and her eyes… they looked at me like she’d been waiting for me all along. She walked right up to me and kissed me. No words, no hesitation—just the kiss.” A faint, involuntary smile crosses her face. “It startled me. But I didn’t pull away. I… liked it. When she stepped back, I asked her what this dream was—what it meant. She only laughed and said it was dinner time.”  “Next thing I knew, we were standing by a campfire. The place looked lived in—bedrolls, ashes, the faint smell of old smoke and wine. Vera moved like she’d been here a thousand times before. She carried a plate in her hands. And on it…”  Valindra hesitates, then continues quietly.  “…was a heart. A small one. Human. She smiled as if it were a delicacy and told me it was Ria’s.”  Her fingers twitch, and her voice hardens.
   “I told her that wasn’t funny. She only tilted her head and said that Lord Sajj’aka would understand—that He had told me to keep Ria safe, after all.” Valindra looks away then, eyes shadowed.  “And that’s when He spoke. Not through Vera—through the air itself. His voice was everywhere, curling through the dream like smoke: ‘I did tell you that, didn’t I? Safe… for what?’”  She draws a slow breath. “I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t even move. The grotto, the fire, Vera—all of it began to fade, and His words echoed until I woke. My heart was racing, and the warmth of the pool still clung to my skin.”  She falls silent for a long moment. “I don’t think it was just a dream. And I don’t think He was asking.
   It has been a long day, and longer still in thought.
   This morning began with a conversation between Rem and me. I told him I wanted to know more about the past—why a priestess of St. Imalda would turn against her vows. He listened, patient as ever, and when I mentioned my idea of consuming what remained of her mind to find the truth, he talked me out of it. Said that some things are meant to stay buried. Perhaps he’s right. He usually is, when it comes to morality, or at least sanity.
   While we spoke, Perse gathered the others—Ria and Valindra—and reminded them that they are stronger together. I watched from a distance. Perse has a way of binding people with words where others might use rope or oath. Valindra confessed that she’s grown close to Ria, but that her friend’s sorrow had become her own—that she longed to be free of it. Perse, ever the mediator, urged her to think for herself, to act not out of guilt or grief, but out of will.
   It worked.
   Valindra apologized to Ria for their past, and when Ria spoke of vengeance—of blood owed and blood yet to spill—Valindra asked to join her in it. Ria accepted. Perse sealed their accord with a kiss for each of them, smiling like a priestess at a wedding that should not be blessed.
   Later, Perse approached me. She said she could use my help sending messages, and I offered what little skill I had. She showed me an image—an ink drawing of Ophani Cassio Beckett, leader of the Obscura. Cold eyes, sharp smile. The kind of face that belongs in portraits of men who start wars. I told her I’d help her reach him when the time came.
   As the day waned, Valindra led us through rough country. She wasn’t herself—quiet, distracted—but still capable. Near dusk we met a woman on the road: tall, weathered, and older than she looked. She drew a line in the dirt and told us not to cross without paying her toll. Perse tried to question her, but her answers wandered like smoke.
   Something about it stirred a memory. I remembered tales of Detarch, the trickster god who tests travelers on the road, often in the shape of old women asking for tribute. So I stepped forward first. Gave her the silver… well, the silver implement I’d been holding onto since the tower. She took it without flinching.
   The others followed suit. Ria offered her a gallon of wine, Rem a lock of his hair, Valindra her sewer pole, and Perse—true to her nature—gave her a song. It was a song about Lem and Rem, twin figures in some local fable I didn’t know, but the melody was soft and kind. The woman, who named herself Isolde, seemed satisfied. She warned us that danger lay ahead and then vanished down the road without another word.
   Rem beat me in a footrace earlier, before all this. I should record that, if only to be honest with myself. He laughed about it for most of the day.  When I write all this down, it seems absurd—dreams, gods, tolls, and the dead walking among us. Yet somehow, it all feels connected. Ria mentioned her sister Maja, and the name Xi’Talla came up again. That makes three of us now who have dreamed of her—or of things that point her way.

   Bandits ahead. Time to Take out our frustrations

## Notes
- META: Chris misused the word betrothal, Hades is in a relationship with Xchimaltia. 
- Dreams
	- Lewis - awoke alone in Tiny Hut, trees are dead and bare - blood red sunset, tall figure 100ft away, arms outstretched. Lewis left the barrier, LG greeted him & warned him that we've attracted the attn of his sister. Not a lot of time to decide - accept the LG's offer or Xi'talla will have him instead. Pressured him to take his hand and swear the oath, running out of time. LG's face started leaking black fluid, in pain, fell to their knees, Lewis took their hand. LG's hand decomposed into maggots. Same creepy laughter from before. He woke up.
	- Ria - trance, smelled incense, in an empty gothic church. Someone praying, her sister. Ria summoned a bit of magic in her hand, approached. Sister told her not to come back. Ria asked in disbelief if that was the first thing she wanted to say to her in 15 years. Sister warned her there's nothing left for her at home. Ria said she knows, not returning for herself. 
		- Sister asked why return? Unfinished business, debts to pay. Sister asked if she was one of them -- no, she's not home. 
		- Ria asked where she is, sister can't tell. Missing both eyes, hornets crawling out. If she tells, it will bring Ria closer to "her" (Xi'talla?).
			- Insight check - this does seem like her real sister
		- Sister apologized to Ria. Ria asked how this happened. Sister said their mother isn't the only influential mother. Ria said the Orthodoxy should've protected her from this, how did she come into contact with Xi'talla? Sister can't tell her, still loves her, wants to protect her from seeing what she has. Don't come back.
			- Ria said she can't accept that request. Loud buzzing, swarming hornets. Promised her sister Maja (Maya) that she would free her. Woke up.
	- Rem - awoke in a cell, Jonas's basement. Jonas, bloodied, sitting on the dissection table, eating a pear. Asked how Rem was doing. Rem checked for his wounds, said times were trying. Jonas expressed his sympathy. 
		- Rem asked if he knows why we killed him, Jonas says yes, he doesn't blame us for it. Rem asked what Mastenovti wanted out of his deal. Jonas doesn't know. 
		- Rem pointed out even if the demonic cure worked, there had to have been a catch. Jonas hoped it would have been contained to himself, but the cure lives on inside of Rem. Jonas asked what he intends to do with it. Rem intends to get rid of the lycanthropy. Jonas said it could be the hope/cure of thousands.
		- Rem said he'd love to cure them, but his demonic lycanthropy isn't the answer. Jonas said Rem has now also tainted the cure with Karz's blood. Rem asked if he should just give his blood to the infected -- Jonas said maybe not yet, but give it a chance--don't seek a remedy for something that isn't an ailment.
		- Rem asked if Jonas has dreams of running every night. Jonas didn't, but dreams of ripping apart the people he loved the most. Rem said he doesn't have to dream for that part -- Jonas asked for elaboration, Rem said dwai.
		- Rem asked for more info about the lycanthropy, how to control it? Not much info - Jonas gave him a key under the bars, said Rem had a choice to do something great. Let himself out or stay in the cell. Rem said if not this cell, there'd be another. Jonas said it doesn't have to be that way. Don't let his work go to waste, be a hero. 
		- Jonas faded away. Rem picked up the key. Private DM 1:1! He looked down at it, then woke up.
	- Valindra - in a grotto, pool of water, nude figure emerged - Vera. Vera walked straight up to her and kissed her on the mouth. Acting marital.
		- Valindra was surprised, stepped back, asked where they were. Vera asked what she meant, does she feel ok? Valindra asked why she kissed her. Vera: why wouldn't I? Didn't you like it? Valindra says it's her first time, it was pleasant but surprising. Vera felt Valindra's forehead, asked if she was feeling well, said she was acting strange -- like they've never kissed before. Valindra was very confused.
		- Vera called her dear and told her they should eat dinner, led her by the hand to a campfire. Valindra doesn't have her weapon but is in her normal gear.
		- Vera brought a plate with a heart, smaller, human. It's Ria's. Vera said they need to finish the ritual. Valindra was panicked, said she has to protect her. Body of Ria lying behind them, big hole carved out. Vera said this was for Lord SJ. Valindra argued, said to keep her safe.
		- Lord SJ's voice - "I did tell you that, didn't I?" Safe for what? Valindra speechless, woke up.
- In the morning
	- Ria, Lewis, Valindra all woke up disturbed. Ria was pissed, lightning crackling. 
		- Lewis pulled out the bag of holding, found the hand of the LG.
		- Perse asked if they were well, asked what happened.
			- Lewis explained the LG visited him in his dreams, was like his power faded, he heard the heirophant laughing again. Says something needs to be done.
			- Ria agreed, said its master needs to die, vehement. It has her sister. Ria is going to find her. 
			- Valindra said Lord SJ spoke to her, first time. She was shaky and disturbed, staring at Ria. Said he told her to kill her. Ria said it was obvious, said he's been using her. Lord SJ wants its power/life back. Valindra didn't think Ria had to die for that, Ria questioned why. Valindra said she was shown something different at first. Perse asked what was her first vision - it showed Valindra who RIa was so that she could find her, Valindra protecting her.
				- Her second vision - Vera brought Ria's heart and told her to eat it. 
		- Perse steadied Ria with a hand. Asked about Rem, he also had a dream - told us about Jonas, embrace the lycanthropy to use it as a cure and combine it with his own blood. 
		- Perse asked Valindra if she'd still kill Ria, asked if she'd confide in her first if she changed her mind. Valindra said she still wants to protect her. 
		- Lewis said the bug goddess seems like she's recruiting, Ria suspects infiltration into the orthodoxy, where her sister was sent. Maja Drakesbane.
		- We speculated why it happened to all of them at once - prob related to deeper understanding of Xi'talla who attacks the mind.
	- Lewis and Rem went off to pray
		- Lewis said it was for a morning activity. Said he needs answers, this is the only way he knows how. Why would a priest turn against St. Imelda? He pulled out the decapitated head, rotting brain matter, said he's surprised Ria isn't stopping him. Rem offered to tell him the answer if he didn't eat it. Lewis: if he believes him, yes.
			- Rem said they both know what that cult is worshipping - to know that entity is to harbor corruption. Whatever corrupted the priestess, it wasn't who she once was. She was forced into it. Lewis disagreed. Rem said by entertaining these thoughts, Lewis is letting the corruption win. Said he can come back and reconsecrate it, but don't lower himself to this. 
			- Lewis was convinced and stopped. Agreed he could come back and hallow this place again. Lewis tried to bury the head, had to make an int save, succeeded. They shared a moment, Rem has his back. 
	- Girl convo - Ria seems like she's compartmentalizing. Perse grabbed both her and Ria by the shoulders, wrapped her arms around them, tried to comfort them, told them to take a deep breath. Valindra doesn't want to hurt her. Ria said Lord SJ will want vengeance. Perse asked Valindra what she would want to do if no one told her anything. She said she ran away the last time she wanted to do something, to be free. Perse asked why. She just watched her friend died, she held Solana as she died and didn't want that anymore. She doesn't want to have the pain anymore. Wants purpose.
		- Perse asked purpose to fill the hole left behind? That and she wanted more from life. Thought she had found it with lord SJ, but not sure if it's right anymore. Ria says she has no intentions of helping. They're both pawns of lord SJ. 
		- I gently encouraged Valindra to live for herself, find out what she likes to do. Valindra likes to help people, wants to help Ria to atone for what she's done. She's good at killing people. They have an accord.
		- Perse kissed Ria and Valindra on the cheek and let them go. Valindra asked what a kiss on the lips with a girl meant. I said it was romantic, we'd discuss this more along the road. 
- Porto - Perse told him we'd be taking the long way around, said we'd see him in a month. Porto was created for Mastanovti, doesn't remember his previous life. Perse told him if he requires work she'd happily hire him. 
	- Lewis and Perse discussed - Lewis told me he can cast Sending to Porto at any time. She asked if he could send a message to Ophani to ask more about the state of the Orthodoxy.
- Travelling north
	- Later in the day -- tall woman, Perse called out and greeted her. She crossed a line in the path. Seems quirky. Strange, very old. **Isolde**.
		- She says she's seen corpse moths before, a long time ago. 
		- Lewis knows this woman could be related to the god Zetarch (trickery, wisdom, freedom). He offered the silver dildo. The woman asked if he was going to use it.  He said it's more of a solo activity. She let Lewis pass.
		- Ria offered wine.  Passed.
		- Rem offered a lock of hair. She spit on it and slapped it on the dildo.
		- Perse sang the Ballad of Lem and Rim.
		- She knew my name and bid us farewell. Warned us of bandits awaiting to ambush us.
