## Summary
The party slew their would-be assassins. Taryn appeared and took Rem, Ria, and Valindra to speak with Zarunok. Rem swore he would do his best to ensure stability after deposing the Rexum. The party rested and Perse dispelled the chains around the tome.

## IC Synopsis - Tales from Persephone
> We round the corner with the knowledge from the old woman of the ambush in front of us. Even knowing it was coming they were still faster. Just as we got them a barrage of poison tipped crossbow bolts pummel into me. Everything goes dark as I fall off Wuffi's saddle. It is but a moment later under the sound of crackling thunder that breath returns to me as I see Lewis standing over me administering his magic. 
   A hard fought fight followed, with Persephone controlling the enemies with her alluring magic. We slay them one by one. It is in the after of the fight that we find a bounty on the assassin leader's person. The bounty is well detailed for our party, offering 500 gold on each of us. The bounty is signed only with "G". The others speculate that it would be Lucious Grubb from Maghaven. 
   While they search the rest of the bodies, I take the time to remove the crossbow bolts from my body. The pain much easier to manage now that the poison is gone. As we search the area of the battlefield we find the body of the old woman we spoke to. She appears to have been dead for sometime. As I assist Rem with digging the grave the thought occurs to me as to who we actually spoke with if she was already dead. Perhaps the others would have some insight.
   As we depart towards Temut, we take a slower more stealthy approach, hoping to avoid anymore would be killers. It is fortunate that my magic is mostly well suited for this type of travel. It still seems to fail as we come upon a familiar face of the Miss Taryn. The one we met in Maghaven who deceived us into thinking she was a seamstress. Persephone does not let her deception continue and demands Taryn to speak plainly as to why she sought us out. She speaks of our mission for the artifacts, as well as her being an agent Zarunok. As she reveals this point, her body shifts. Doing away with a human disguise, growing much taller, and showing us her true form. A woman of large statue, magnificent wings, and a horned head.
   After the initial shock of this reveal, Taryn states she was sent by Zarunok himself to task us with retrieving his chains. Rem brings up the point of using the chains to recover Karz's sword. Taryn gives us the option to speak with Zarnok himself. After some back and forth Rem agrees to speak with him. Ria and I wish to go along as back up, though, knowing Taryn was after the heart last time, I decided to leave it with Lewis. Removing the heart for the first time hurt. An intense cold washed over me. It did feel a little empty without it. After that, Taryn slices open a portal with her scythe and we head through it. 
   Zarunok was quite impressive. We existed on an empty plain. As if we were floating but still on firm ground. I felt disconnected from the land. Rem and the god spoke at length.  Zarunok wanted his chains back, but also noted the removal of the Rexum. Rem agrees with removing the Rexum, and forges an oath with the god. For use of the chains, and removal of the Rexum, Zarunok also offers to help in the time after, to find balance in a new order. A brand appears on Rem's hand after this. 
   After our return, Taryn bids us farewell as she heads to the south to her next task, spying on the Living God. As camp about half a day out from Temut, Rem accounts our meeting with the god to the others. A long conversation followed with Perse suggesting that Rem be the new king after the fall of the Rexum. Though humble about the thought, Rem does not outright dismiss the notion. He surely knows more about humanity than I do. His heart for sure seems in the right place, perhaps the world would be better with Rem at the helm. 
   As I make my way over to Lewis to have him repair my armor, I notice out of the corner of my eye, Persephone performing magic on the book we found in the black dragon's den. It appears her magic succeeded in what ever was binding this book. I wonder what is inside it?

## Notes
- We killed the ruffians (assassins)? Black hooded uniforms. We investigated the bodies, their leader had orders to kill us by description, last known location (Maghaven) - suspected destination (town to the north), 500g per head, signed G. 
	- Corpse of Isolde here, killed with a slice to the neck. Was the Isolde we met earlier a fake? This one doesn't have anything we gave her. We buried her. Lewis cast Ceremony, funeral rites. 
- Perse suggested we skip Temut to avoid exposing them to danger, party discussed buying mounts in disguise.
	- Rem asked if Lewis had everything he needed for the cure, he said yes.
		- Perse asked if we should draw Rem's blood beforehand, he said we'd talk about it
- Later - Taryn appeared, walking towards us, smiled and waved. Seems like she was looking for us. She asked how our time in Maghaven was. I told her to get to the point.
	- She said she knows we're looking for things. She transformed into a huge devillish/angelic red-skinned woman, carrying a large golden scythe. Lewis admired her beautiful blade.
	- Rem said she seeks us out bc we seek her master's artifacts, she agreed. She wants our help in regaining an artifact. She's a servant of Zarunok, looking for his chains to return them to him. Rem suggested with the chains we might be able to retrieve the Sword of Karz. She says Zarunok has plans for him. Doesn't want any artifacts delivered to the Rexum. 
	- Perse asked why the gods are so hands off, she said the GD doesn't want them to take it back. Perse suggested it might be against the GD's will to return it to Zarunok. Rem asked if Zarunok would be willing to let us keep the chains if we used them against the Rexum to retrieve the Sword, asked Taryn to arrange a discussion. Taryn offered to take us to him. Can't tell us where in advance.
		- Valindra asked what would happen if we didn't return the chains - he will continue to try and take it. Taryn isn't the only servant of his looking for them. 
		- Perse asked if she could promise no harm could come to us, she said we'd have to be respectful. Couldn't promise us.
			- Valindra asked if he might try to take the heart. Perhaps. Zarunok doesn't care about "elves being tainted", we're all just mortals to him.
	- We split the party, Lewis and Perse would stay behind, the rest would head with Taryn to talk to Zarunok. Valindra took off the heart of etifa, cold damage, gave it to Lewis who put it in the bag of holding.
- Zarunok conversation
	- Etheral, red stars, in space. Taryn introduced them. Zarunok asked for confirmation of our mission. Rem confirmed we are seeking the artifacts. 
		- Zarunok asked why. Rem said that's a question he's been asking himself. Said we were nominated by the factions of Dominion to retrieve the artifacts for the Rexum. Rem said he's sworn to serve the GD, wondering if that's the best way to do it. Z asked why we haven't taken it back yet. Rem asked to keep the chains to help retrieve the sword of Karz. Z asked if we mean to kill the Rexum.
			- Rem said he knows that the Rexum chooses not to do more about the plague. He deserves to be stripped of power. Z asked what happens after. Rem wants peace, prosperity, plenty, to help those inflicted by the plague.
		- Z said he's at an impasse. Says someone should take the Rexum's place. Asked if Rem thought himself worthy. Rem said he'd prob be terrible at it, but the bar is low. Z said he won't make the same mistake of choosing another champion, but does want to see the Rxm fall. Asks that if Rem uses the chains, make sure he has something in mind to replace the Rexum to avoid chaos. If he can do that, we'll have his blessing. Rem swore he'd pursue the best course of action that he can. 
			- Z said we have his blessing to make the decisions necessary. He asked that Ria and Valindra also have a plan after killing the Rexum to avoid chaos. 
		- Z said he'd grant us use of the chains. Retrieve them and use them to bring down the Rexum. Then he'll aid in the aftermath. If we're not up to replacing him, we'll find another solution. Rem agreed to it, shook his hand, and his hand burned his symbol in his. 
	- Z mentioned he wants Taryn to collect more info on someone else. 
		- Rem mentioned the LG, that is who Taryn will be looking into. Z said forget anything the LG said, this isn't their world, said the LG is an abomination that will be destroyed, don't listen to its lies. 
		- Ria stayed quiet, Valindra stepped up, asked about the LG's sister - Rem clarified the Apex Queen. Z got mad, repeated not to listen to any lies, there is no "other" (Apex Queen). Had Taryn take us away. 
- They returned to us
	- Taryn said beware the undead corruption as we proceeded to the city. Questioned if Valindra was being influenced by the LG. Warned that foul things seek us, be careful. 
- Camp
	- Rem filled us in on what happened with Z
		- He brought up the fact that we have the means to change Skediwen's future. He believes we don't serve anyone well by returning it to the Rxm. 
			- Ria doesn't give a shit about the Rexum
			- Lewis was shocked, asked Rem about it. Rem believes the Rexum could be doing more to help the people but chooses not to. Lewis agreed the Rexum only wanted the artifacts for himself. Rem said when he was a boy and Karz's sap was discovered to cure the plague, they immediately stopped administering it. 
		- Perse asked if we should start preparing for the rise of king Rem. Rem asked why him, mentioned Ria might be better. Ria said she doesn't see a future for herself. Said there are far better leaders than him. Perse said he'd potentially be the best option. He said he'd do what must be done. We could get the other factions to turn against the Rexum, minimize damage in the coup. 
			- She joked about it, said he was an interesting project, could write songs about him.
		- Rem helped Perse dispel the lock on the tome
- TEXT RP
	- Lewis and Valindra conversed, talked about improving her armor. Valindra asked for advice on how Lewis keeps his faith, worried about being misled and expressed doubts in Lord Sajjaka. Lewis encouraged her to be happy & at peace with her choices and do what she believes is right. 
	- Perse gave Rem a cold rock to cool his brand. Ria and them discussed plans to potentially overthrow the Rexum. Perse and Rem initially clashed about going to the underdark but cooled off. Perse got somewhat tipsy and explained the history of the Demon Age as she knows it.
		- Rem cast Zone of Truth - Perse slit her palm, blood oath, and Ria showed off her draconic hands. Some more personable, vulnerable moments shared.
		- Oaths
			- Rem to Perse:
				- “Do you swear to me, by all you hold dear, that you will help me depose the Rexum? In exchange, I shall help you learn the fates of your husband and son.”
				- “Do you swear that my blood will only be used to research and develop a cure for the secomortis plague, and for no other purpose? To keep my blood in your personal possession, and share it only with my explicit permission? To avoid any unnecessary side effects in the development of said cure? To freely share a viable cure, or any knowledge gained in the pursuit of such a cure, with those that suffer from the plague?”
			- Perse to Rem: 
				- "I swear to you," Persephone replies in a mellow, level tone, "by all I hold dear, with mine right yours and yours mine, that if you help me learn the fates of my son and soulbond, I will help you depose the Rexum."
				- "Yes, of the blood you give me freely and in good faith, I do. And also I won't go nefariously slurping up all the blood you're spilling all over Skediwen in buckets unless you ask me to. Does that suffice?"
			- Rem/Ria - same effectively as Rem's about his blood. Rem also mentioned he'd assist in whatever she asked.
	- Perse asked Rem about his oaths to the Grand Divine. They discussed the LG, AQ, his beliefs, the Rexum, Jonas, the plague, the lycanthropy etc.
	- Lewis complimented Ria's hands in a very intense, poetic way, called her over. Ria insisted she was deformed/mutated/a monster, told him to knock if off. Lewis complimented her in a rather descriptive and heavy way, insisted she was beautiful, embraced her. Ria teleported out and left the dome. Lewis followed and proclaimed she had his trust. Ria threw the cloak/ring back at him. 
		- Lewis Quotes:
			- "“Most metal only pretends at strength. Yours was built for it. Those scales..." Lewis at a lose for words. He looks up at Ria's face and gives her a warm smile as the words form clearly. "they sit cleaner than plate, overlap smoother than chain, and catch the light like worked bronze. That’s elegance no forge can touch.” Lewis looks to the sky. " a body body built to weather storms and the electrifying power coiled beneath the surface."
			- “Listen...your mutation doesn’t make you lesser. It doesn’t make you unsightly. It makes you Ria. And whether you believe it or not, there is strength and craft in every line of those scales. I wasn’t complimenting a deformity. I was complimenting you.” Lewis looks around a little embarrassed he said this out loud. “Ria… later on, could I see your hands again? Not because they’re strange—because they’re yours. And I want to understand the parts of you you keep guarded.”
			- “Ria… if you were a monster, you wouldn’t care how anyone sees you. Monsters don’t flinch at kindness. They don’t hide hurt behind teeth and claws.” Lewis stops just within reach, voice low and steady.“You can threaten me all you want. I’m not fixated." he looks into her eye's. "I’m worried. And I’m not walking away from you when you’re hurting.” He pulls her into a tight, grounded embrace, even knowing she could unleash her electrical repertoire. “And I won’t sharpen that lie by agreeing with it.”
			- "Ria… I hear you. I shouldn’t have reached for you. I won’t again.” he looks toward her and says in a low voice. "I don’t want your fear. Or your anger. Only your trust" Lewis then turns to walk back into the dome. "When you decide I've earned it. I know you have earned mine."
			- “Ria reacted the way metal does when taken from the quench too soon...hissing, snapping, full of tension. Any attempt to hold her, shape her, or even praise her seemed to draw that same fierce recoil.” he puts the ring on top of the cloak. " Valindra she must be refined!" he says in thought as he stows the cloak and ring into the bag of holding.
		- Valindra intervened and pulled him back in, gently reminded him that Ria didn't want or need his help and that he should give her space. Lewis compared her to shaping/refining metal but later apologized and retracted his words.
		- Persephone chewed Lewis out for being overbearing, and a creepy niceguy, then left the dome for air. 
		- Lewis was confused and said he was just complimenting Ria. Rem told Lewis his apologies wouldn't matter until he understood what he did wrong, and encouraged him to ask Ria and listen about her experiences instead of telling her what she is.
