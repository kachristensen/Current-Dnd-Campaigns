###### Day 21

## Summary
The party fought more insects and cultists.

## IC Synopsis - As Informed by Eifert
>We encountered several ettercaps as we delved beneath the desecrated shrine of St. Imelda.  Perse’s magic sprung forth from the ceiling and held one of the creatures in place as we combatted our elevated enemies.  A third ettercap led us further in and two umber hulks encircled us as we took the bait.  Perse summoned a giant insect to serve her in battle and be her steed, but the creature would prove far inferior to Anicca and fall in the fight.  Even so, we made short work of the umber hulks and continued deeper still.
  Webs blocked our path, but with some oil and fiery spellcraft it proved a minor obstruction.  What was more troublesome was the ettercap that tried to sneak up on us from another path at the fork.  The creature itself was little trouble, but the hellwasps and drider that joined it were more capable adversaries.  Personal issues aside, we continue to perform well as a combat unit and we dispatched the insectoid creatures efficiently.  Large sacks of eggs awaited us down this particular branch of the cave, which we smashed and burned and destroyed in any manner convenient to us.
  Having given the webs time to burn, we returned to the fork and followed the revealed path.  A voice called out to us as we approached, and we found four cultists in a ruined stone room.  Another skirmish ensued as Valindra entered and was struck by a radiant bolt, this one the most challenging of the expedition by far.  Perse’s Slow sapped the Stingers while Ria and Valindra struck.  Twice, Lewis had his Walls of Fire counterspelled, and twice was I grappled by the Aberrant.  Perse freed me with teleportation magic once, while simultaneously cornering the Hierophant together with Lewis.  She summoned her giant insect once more as we pursued the fleeing Hierophant and dispatched the Aberrant at last.  Unsettling noises emanated from the doorway at the end of the hall, but we had won the moment and needed a moment to regroup…

## Notes
- Tunnels seem jagged, not naturally made. We killed a lot more driders, etter caps, umber hulks, hellwasps, etc.
- Voice called out to us, asked what have you done to the children. A woman in the same yellow robes from the cult we saw before in Maghaven. Heard a door shutting. Other cultists, fight.
